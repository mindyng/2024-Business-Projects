       "      <td>[Here's what I think about this update - \\n1. If it runs most of the AI stuff on device and the personal cloud computing really does what Apple says, like not storing any data, being totally encrypted etc and IF WE CAN IMPROVE THE AI IN OUR PHONE using our own data without sending it back to any server then it's huge, like massive. \\n\\n2. The new icons especially the tinted one sucks, overall I feel the UI does give more freedom but it doesn't look that good, it comes nowhere near material design.\\n\\n3. This is probably the biggest iOS update in a long time if Apple can make Siri more powerful, or powerful enough that we don't need to do anything in chatGpt at all then I can really see a reason to go for pro models, Safari don’t load websites very annoying but with chrome straight away, every year people expecting multitasking capabilities and split screen features but never came out,again Android phones have it for years, basically iPhone is trying to coping Android features that they have for years like for example widgets home screen but they do it so poorly not even close…By the way color change icons is a joke is another desperate way to allow the iPhone user to do something on icons when you have it for years a possibility the chance to change the entire icons design on Android phones. Basically what they are doing is put ther phones with the same features but take ages for a consumer get does features on iPhone that’s why people move to Android. People tired to wait years for developments, basically Apple software customization and  innovation departments in the last 10 years don’teven close what Android phones offer, even a Android phone released 10 years ago the software is more advanced compared to a brand new iPhone. All this years im still thinking IPhone can have the advanced software that Android phones have it, but Apple is doing this transition very slow so that away not being very noticeable. To be honest every person that have both phones straight away agree with me, basically if you only use Android phone you don’t understand that your phone Operating System is so blast advanced.\\nOn the other hand a person that uses only IPhone don’t understand how basic the IOS iPhone operating system it is compared to Android Operating system software looks like living in a stone age, honestly just to put you in perspective when you use Android phone feels like the Android phone user is already in 2035 at least . But don’t forget when you buy a Android phone don’t buy the cheapest one because you need at least a medium performance processor so you good on average price don’t need to be a top line or a flagship Android phone but if you can affordit better., Summarized by AskTube\\n\\nWWDC Keynote Highlights 📱\\n00:02 Apple's WWDC keynote was filled with exciting announcements, including a surprise introduction to AI in the second half.\\n\\n00:25 The author live-tweeted the event and summarizes all the key announcements and thoughts.\\n\\nVision OS 2.0 📊\\n00:47 Vision OS 2.0 brings new features like wrist-turn gestures to see time and battery percentage, and quick access to the control center.\\n\\n01:05 New Immersive Media Features: Turn old photos into spatial photos using advanced machine learning, and create spatial videos on non-iPhone cameras.\\n\\niOS Updates 📱\\n02:29 iOS got a major update with customizable home screens, icon placement, and a new theme engine.\\n\\n02:54 Customize your home screen with different colors, and change icon and widget colors to match your wallpaper.\\n\\nOther Updates 📊\\n03:37 Mac mirroring gets a higher resolution, and new tools are available for creating spatial and immersive videos.\\n\\n04:00 New features include scheduling text messages, text formatting, a game mode that minimizes background activity, and automatic categorization in the new mail app.\\n\\nAirPods and Apple TV Updates 🎧\\n06:05 AirPods got minor updates, including voice isolation during phone calls, spatial audio during games, and nodding or shaking for responding to prompts.\\n\\n06:25 Apple TV updates include showing actors' and characters' names on screen and boosting people's voices over the music.\\n\\niPad OS Updates 📊\\n06:41 iPad OS allows remote control of someone's iPad with their permission, perfect for family tech support.\\n\\n07:03 The calculator app on iPad OS is impressive, letting you write equations in handwriting and getting real-time answers.\\n\\nMac OS Updates 📊\\n09:40 Mac OS got a new version called Sequoia, featuring automatic window snapping, built-in backgrounds for webcam feeds, and a new password app.\\n\\nApple Intelligence AI 🤖\\n10:40 Apple rebranded AI as Apple Intelligence, bringing new generative models and large language models to supported devices.\\n\\n11:01 Apple Intelligence features include writing tools, a cleanup tool in Photos, and generative emojis.\\n\\nHow Apple Handles Complex AI Tasks 💻\\n15:10 Apple handles most AI tasks on-device, using Apple-built models for faster processing. However, for complex tasks, Apple has two alternative approaches.\\n\\n15:32 One approach uses a larger server-based model on Apple's Private Cloud compute, ensuring data is not stored or sent to Apple, but may have downsides like slower processing and internet dependence.\\n\\n15:54 The other approach asks the user for permission to use ChatGPT, allowing access to its capabilities and generating more realistic and varied images.\\n\\nPrivacy and Security of AI Features 🔒\\n16:18 Apple ensures privacy and security by not storing requests, obscuring IP addresses, and preventing OpenAI from forming a profile. All this is done without an account and for free.\\n\\nInsights on Apple's AI Announcements 🤔\\n17:01 The author believes Apple's AI features are superior, with personalization and existing user info making them more effective.\\n\\n17:25 The AI announcements overshadow other features, marking a new age for Apple, and the author is excited to explore its capabilities and what it can bring to users.\\n\\nConclusion and Future Content 📹\\n18:06 The author will create more videos about Apple's AI features and encourages viewers to subscribe for updates.]</td>\n",

Very, very sad.  Their marketing and advertising has taken over, trying to convince you that their products are somewhat advanced.  They're not.  Psychology plays as a primary role in their efforts and effects.  Until we ALL push back and get  to innovate like they used to 20 years ago, expect more incremental upgrades without delivery.

       "0    [Here's what I think about this update - \\n1. If it runs most of the AI stuff on device and the personal cloud computing really does what Apple says, like not storing any data, being totally encrypted etc and IF WE CAN IMPROVE THE AI IN OUR PHONE using our own data without sending it back to any server then it's huge, like massive. \\n\\n2. The new icons especially the tinted one sucks, overall I feel the UI does give more freedom but it doesn't look that good, it comes nowhere near material design.\\n\\n3. This is probably the biggest iOS update in a long time if Apple can make Siri more powerful, or powerful enough that we don't need to do anything in chatGpt at all then I can really see a reason to go for pro models, Safari don’t load websites very annoying but with chrome straight away, every year people expecting multitasking capabilities and split screen features but never came out,again Android phones have it for years, basically iPhone is trying to coping Android features that they have for years like for example widgets home screen but they do it so poorly not even close…By the way color change icons is a joke is another desperate way to allow the iPhone user to do something on icons when you have it for years a possibility the chance to change the entire icons design on Android phones. Basically what they are doing is put ther phones with the same features but take ages for a consumer get does features on iPhone that’s why people move to Android. People tired to wait years for developments, basically Apple software customization and  innovation departments in the last 10 years don’teven close what Android phones offer, even a Android phone released 10 years ago the software is more advanced compared to a brand new iPhone. All this years im still thinking IPhone can have the advanced software that Android phones have it, but Apple is doing this transition very slow so that away not being very noticeable. To be honest every person that have both phones straight away agree with me, basically if you only use Android phone you don’t understand that your phone Operating System is so blast advanced.\\nOn the other hand a person that uses only IPhone don’t understand how basic the IOS iPhone operating system it is compared to Android Operating system software looks like living in a stone age, honestly just to put you in perspective when you use Android phone feels like the Android phone user is already in 2035 at least . But don’t forget when you buy a Android phone don’t buy the cheapest one because you need at least a medium performance processor so you good on average price don’t need to be a top line or a flagship Android phone but if you can affordit better., Summarized by AskTube\\n\\nWWDC Keynote Highlights 📱\\n00:02 Apple's WWDC keynote was filled with exciting announcements, including a surprise introduction to AI in the second half.\\n\\n00:25 The author live-tweeted the event and summarizes all the key announcements and thoughts.\\n\\nVision OS 2.0 📊\\n00:47 Vision OS 2.0 brings new features like wrist-turn gestures to see time and battery percentage, and quick access to the control center.\\n\\n01:05 New Immersive Media Features: Turn old photos into spatial photos using advanced machine learning, and create spatial videos on non-iPhone cameras.\\n\\niOS Updates 📱\\n02:29 iOS got a major update with customizable home screens, icon placement, and a new theme engine.\\n\\n02:54 Customize your home screen with different colors, and change icon and widget colors to match your wallpaper.\\n\\nOther Updates 📊\\n03:37 Mac mirroring gets a higher resolution, and new tools are available for creating spatial and immersive videos.\\n\\n04:00 New features include scheduling text messages, text formatting, a game mode that minimizes background activity, and automatic categorization in the new mail app.\\n\\nAirPods and Apple TV Updates 🎧\\n06:05 AirPods got minor updates, including voice isolation during phone calls, spatial audio during games, and nodding or shaking for responding to prompts.\\n\\n06:25 Apple TV updates include showing actors' and characters' names on screen and boosting people's voices over the music.\\n\\niPad OS Updates 📊\\n06:41 iPad OS allows remote control of someone's iPad with their permission, perfect for family tech support.\\n\\n07:03 The calculator app on iPad OS is impressive, letting you write equations in handwriting and getting real-time answers.\\n\\nMac OS Updates 📊\\n09:40 Mac OS got a new version called Sequoia, featuring automatic window snapping, built-in backgrounds for webcam feeds, and a new password app.\\n\\nApple Intelligence AI 🤖\\n10:40 Apple rebranded AI as Apple Intelligence, bringing new generative models and large language models to supported devices.\\n\\n11:01 Apple Intelligence features include writing tools, a cleanup tool in Photos, and generative emojis.\\n\\nHow Apple Handles Complex AI Tasks 💻\\n15:10 Apple handles most AI tasks on-device, using Apple-built models for faster processing.

                            [Ah, the good old Apple incremental upgrades, since Jobs passed away in 2011.  It's expected, and has now become ad nauseam.  The elephant in the room is that they cannot innovate any more.  That era has gone.  There is too much under Cook that points to profits, not taking risks, and not pursuing innovation at all costs.  Very, very sad.  Their marketing and advertising has taken over, trying to convince you that their products are somewhat advanced.  They're not.  Psychology plays as a primary role in their efforts and effects.  Until we ALL push back and get  to innovate like they used to 20 years ago, expect more incremental upgrades without delivery.  AI development with ChatGPT? What a colossal joke.  You should already be 10+ years ahead in AI development, Apple.  You had your chance.  You ALL need to channel Steve Jobs in your daily efforts.  WWSJD?, Only apple can do..., Apple ... what ?]  \n",

I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions. \\n\\nI could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter!\\n\\nI just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro. \\n\\nThis came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\"\\n\\nI already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup. \\n\\nApple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels.\\n\\nSoftwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works.\\n\\nSo, I'm out, except for Mac., Apple finally can move their icons anywhere and people think it's something great like Samsung didn't have it 10 years ago 😭😭😭, These are not new features, been on android for years.]</td>\n",

All of this new customization they're giving us and they don't do anything with icon packs? That would have been great. One neat thing I noticed is the ability to remove icon app names, but they way it's implemented isn't very Apple Intelligent. The icons are expanded in size, removing the app names. It would have been much better to just give us a toggle. I don't want larger icons. I'm still going to stick with my custom icons that I don't give a name to., You couldn't move around the icons on the home screen on iPhone until 2024?, I really want to know if i can keep the \"normal\" color icons when in dark mode.

       "0    [My takeaway was that across MacOS, iOS and iPadOS I found very few things that I could tell I would include in my daily use.\\n\\nI already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions. \\n\\nI could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter!\\n\\nI just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro. \\n\\nThis came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\"\\n\\nI already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup. \\n\\nApple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels.\\n\\nSoftwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works.\\n\\nSo, I'm out, except for Mac., Apple finally can move their icons anywhere and people think it's something great like Samsung didn't have it 10 years ago 😭😭😭, These are not new features, been on android for years.]  \n",

I'm excited about AI baked into iOS for sure.  I was hoping to see them talk about iOS keyboard improvements tho. Hopefully ChatGPT is used to make their swipe text prediction better, because it's absolutely horrible. Also..... how in 2024 do we not have a GD MF'N NUMBER ROW??? I'm over this shit. I have to use Swiftkey because it's that important of a keyboard feature for me. \\n\\nThe home screen customization is welcomed, but the icon hue slider is going to create some ugly home screens. All of this new customization they're giving us and they don't do anything with icon packs? That would have been great. One neat thing I noticed is the ability to remove icon app names, but they way it's implemented isn't very Apple Intelligent. The icons are expanded in size, removing the app names. It would have been much better to just give us a toggle. I don't want larger icons. I'm still going to stick with my custom icons that I don't give a name to., You couldn't move around the icons on the home screen on iPhone until 2024?, I really want to know if i can keep the \"normal\" color icons when in dark mode.

No longer need my fingers anymore! 🤣 What a time to be alive!\", Just checked my iPhone 11 calculator, still no history.  Calc+ is still my go to because it allows me to delete last digit entered and shows me all my numbers entered for the current calculation.  Simple.  Come on Apple., The calculator app is great but please folks, it is not the first to do it. Microsoft's AI math calculator app has been out for over 9 years. Apple just made theirs a little better.]  \n",

       "3  The most important question, at least for me, is if you have built-in recording software inside the phone, If I understand correctly, there will be an addition of an option, but what happens if I want to record a phone that is Android, After all, when I start recording the conversation, the person will be aware of it by an automatic notification from my iPhone that I'm recording it, but what happens with Android, he won't receive any notifications, probably about it, and if at all I can record him?   \n",

       "      <td>My take on WWDC's iPad calculator app: It's nothing more than a gimmick WWDC just dropped yesterday and one of the highlight features was the calculator app feature. MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world. Ok, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks: It’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. You can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly. It can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want. You can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers. The features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools? The first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  In this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. Anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire   That calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad. The second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? Finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. You don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. This reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). It’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. Other examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I will never understand these chucklefucks trying to sell VR as a productivity tool at this stage in its development. Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face. ==================================== My requirements for a phone are actually quite simple:  -a camera with acceptable image quality -no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display -stereo front-facing speakers -a headphone jack as backup for when I need it -expandable storage for when I need it -the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS Thus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone. ==================================== Okay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see. ==================================== I honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet. ==================================== I'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.</td>\n",

       "      <td>My takeaway was that across MacOS, iOS and iPadOS I found very few things that I could tell I would include in my daily use. I already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions.  I could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter! I just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro.  This came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\" I already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup.  Apple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels. Softwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works. So, I'm out, except for Mac.</td>\n",

I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri. 2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap. 3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat. 4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.   5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.) 6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.) I get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Romans 3:23 states: \"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;\". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 \"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\". Romans 10:13 states \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\". \\r \\r    Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Not only that, for most of the presentation they did say that iphone would have apple intelligence and in the end they said only iphone 15 pro models, is like... 😂 okay apple, not all people can afford a 1100 and 1300 dollars usd smartphones, thanks, steve jobs said that apple is for the humanity and to give them technology to improve people's lifes, apple had vision, tim cook did it until 2018, then everything has go slowly downhill, not all of it of course, but very down, not only that, but jobs said that according to our efforts we decide the price of our products, we try the most to price it correctly, well that was in 2009, and for your knowledge, apple intelligence is only available for 2 iphones (of more than 24 iphones eligible for the ios 18 update *oh is because they don't have 6gb of ram, well darling the Android phone of my Granny costs 200 dollars and has 8gb of ddr4 ram and on screen ai analysis to summarize websites with Gemini for free -well you exchange your data even when they say no but i don't believe any company in terms of 100% privacy so it's meh for me, is logic, that's why USA gov wants to ban TikTok cuz they don't have control over their info and the excuse is that they are \"spies\"-, apple does not use a \"unique physical ram\" to justify their price, like i say.. thefts*) but hey you have good animations :D and \"the ecosystem\" that windows and android are reaching more fast than ever to the point of apple, apple= no moral and respectful for people's money and time (so contrary to Steve's apple), yeah they have good and incredible things like the integration of apple intelligence offline but it doesn't help the fact that whenever they do something great they put it like god's new technology to justify prices in this times when they are not the unique smartphone company they were in 2007-2018, others are in the same level or little lower or little higher than them in terms of technology, i hope that the apple directive is changed but that will not happen because money runs the world and if they are still selling, nothing will change.  P.d. They said thar A17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really? They always said new processors of apple silicon are the most fastest in the world all the time, the processor of the iphone 14 pro max is slow? Gosh they are really inmoral capitalists (i agree with capitalism and liberal economies)</td>\n",

       "      <td>My first impression is definitely that they’re playing catch-up, in terms of QoL features. They could’ve done this back in iOS 14 at once, there’s no reason to take 4 years to incorporate all these features. Summarization was already available on Mac, I’ve sent numerous feature requests, asking them to bring it system-wide to iPads and iPhones. This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray. I predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that.  The only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”.  This isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability.  Last time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected.  Furthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac.  - why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing?  Another thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got: - better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago) - Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind.  A few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I want to thank you for always giving us a well thought videos. Others spend time babbling and trying to be funny and you sound like a tech guy giving us tech news. I have a suggestion to take you to a new level. I have been writing Apple for years. I honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. I’ll share them in a moment. By the way I am a software engineer. I am not one who thinks I am so D smart or the smarted person in the room. I love to always learn and ai find I am always learning new things from you. So my idea for you is a real tech news Channel. This will make you something like the Wal Mart of tech news. This idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. I tried to float this to Apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. We have CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iPhone is released. Tech news is happening every day all day. I say join forces with some of the best like yourself, Brian Tong, possibly some from Engadget and create a real Tech News channel. It’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. EVs and Republicans wanting to K EVs, TicTok, Twitter. With social media companies being as influential as they have become. They’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. A real tech news channel will do this. What you and others do is journalism. I want the news to still be fun but I want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a CNN. You will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech CEO’s. It’s a militia billion. Dollar idea I am giving to you. This is something new of its kind and needed. Tech is no longer just mobile. We have stepped into the world of AI and Humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will I pack them. I would love to work with you as a producer or something. I have a huge idea and it will work.</td>\n",

       "1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               My take on WWDC's iPad calculator app: It's nothing more than a gimmick WWDC just dropped yesterday and one of the highlight features was the calculator app feature. MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world. Ok, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks: It’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. You can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly. It can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want. You can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers. The features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools? The first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  In this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. Anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire   That calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad. The second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? Finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. You don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. This reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). It’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. Other examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.  \n",

Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face. ==================================== My requirements for a phone are actually quite simple:  -a camera with acceptable image quality -no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display -stereo front-facing speakers -a headphone jack as backup for when I need it -expandable storage for when I need it -the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS Thus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone. ==================================== Okay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see. ==================================== I honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet. ==================================== I'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.  \n",

How Apple Handles Complex AI Tasks 💻 15:10 Apple handles most AI tasks on-device, using Apple-built models for faster processing. However, for complex tasks, Apple has two alternative approaches. 15:32 One approach uses a larger server-based model on Apple's Private Cloud compute, ensuring data is not stored or sent to Apple, but may have downsides like slower processing and internet dependence. 15:54 The other approach asks the user for permission to use ChatGPT, allowing access to its capabilities and generating more realistic and varied images. Privacy and Security of AI Features 🔒 16:18 Apple ensures privacy and security by not storing requests, obscuring IP addresses, and preventing OpenAI from forming a profile. All this is done without an account and for free.

I already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions.  I could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter! I just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro.  This came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\" I already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup.  Apple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels. Softwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works. So, I'm out, except for Mac.  \n",

There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance: 1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri. 2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap. 3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat. 4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.   5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.) 6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.) I get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.  \n",

We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 \"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\". Romans 10:13 states \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\". \\r \\r    Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.  \n",

                                                           Not only that, for most of the presentation they did say that iphone would have apple intelligence and in the end they said only iphone 15 pro models, is like... 😂 okay apple, not all people can afford a 1100 and 1300 dollars usd smartphones, thanks, steve jobs said that apple is for the humanity and to give them technology to improve people's lifes, apple had vision, tim cook did it until 2018, then everything has go slowly downhill, not all of it of course, but very down, not only that, but jobs said that according to our efforts we decide the price of our products, we try the most to price it correctly, well that was in 2009, and for your knowledge, apple intelligence is only available for 2 iphones (of more than 24 iphones eligible for the ios 18 update *oh is because they don't have 6gb of ram, well darling the Android phone of my Granny costs 200 dollars and has 8gb of ddr4 ram and on screen ai analysis to summarize websites with Gemini for free -well you exchange your data even when they say no but i don't believe any company in terms of 100% privacy so it's meh for me, is logic, that's why USA gov wants to ban TikTok cuz they don't have control over their info and the excuse is that they are \"spies\"-, apple does not use a \"unique physical ram\" to justify their price, like i say.. thefts*) but hey you have good animations :D and \"the ecosystem\" that windows and android are reaching more fast than ever to the point of apple, apple= no moral and respectful for people's money and time (so contrary to Steve's apple), yeah they have good and incredible things like the integration of apple intelligence offline but it doesn't help the fact that whenever they do something great they put it like god's new technology to justify prices in this times when they are not the unique smartphone company they were in 2007-2018, others are in the same level or little lower or little higher than them in terms of technology, i hope that the apple directive is changed but that will not happen because money runs the world and if they are still selling, nothing will change.  P.d. They said thar A17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really? They always said new processors of apple silicon are the most fastest in the world all the time, the processor of the iphone 14 pro max is slow? Gosh they are really inmoral capitalists (i agree with capitalism and liberal economies)  \n",

They could’ve done this back in iOS 14 at once, there’s no reason to take 4 years to incorporate all these features. Summarization was already available on Mac, I’ve sent numerous feature requests, asking them to bring it system-wide to iPads and iPhones. This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray. I predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that.  The only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”.  This isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability.  Last time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected.  Furthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac.  - why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing?  Another thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got: - better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago) - Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind.  A few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.  \n",

Others spend time babbling and trying to be funny and you sound like a tech guy giving us tech news. I have a suggestion to take you to a new level. I have been writing Apple for years. I honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. I’ll share them in a moment. By the way I am a software engineer. I am not one who thinks I am so D smart or the smarted person in the room. I love to always learn and ai find I am always learning new things from you. So my idea for you is a real tech news Channel. This will make you something like the Wal Mart of tech news. This idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. I tried to float this to Apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. We have CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iPhone is released. Tech news is happening every day all day. I say join forces with some of the best like yourself, Brian Tong, possibly some from Engadget and create a real Tech News channel. It’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. EVs and Republicans wanting to K EVs, TicTok, Twitter. With social media companies being as influential as they have become. They’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. A real tech news channel will do this. What you and others do is journalism. I want the news to still be fun but I want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a CNN. You will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech CEO’s. It’s a militia billion. Dollar idea I am giving to you. This is something new of its kind and needed. Tech is no longer just mobile. We have stepped into the world of AI and Humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will I pack them. I would love to work with you as a producer or something. I have a huge idea and it will work.  "

       "      <td>My take on WWDC's iPad calculator app: It's nothing more than a gimmick WWDC just dropped yesterday and one of the highlight features was the calculator app feature. MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world. Ok, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks: It’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. You can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly. It can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want. You can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers. The features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools? The first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  In this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. Anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire   That calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad. The second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? Finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. You don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. This reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). It’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. Other examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I will never understand these chucklefucks trying to sell VR as a productivity tool at this stage in its development. Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face. ==================================== My requirements for a phone are actually quite simple:  -a camera with acceptable image quality -no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display -stereo front-facing speakers -a headphone jack as backup for when I need it -expandable storage for when I need it -the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS Thus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone. ==================================== Okay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see. ==================================== I honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet. ==================================== I'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Summarized by AskTube WWDC Keynote Highlights 📱 00:02 Apple's WWDC keynote was filled with exciting announcements, including a surprise introduction to AI in the second half. 00:25 The author live-tweeted the event and summarizes all the key announcements and thoughts. Vision OS 2.0 📊 00:47 Vision OS 2.0 brings new features like wrist-turn gestures to see time and battery percentage, and quick access to the control center. 01:05 New Immersive Media Features: Turn old photos into spatial photos using advanced machine learning, and create spatial videos on non-iPhone cameras. iOS Updates 📱 02:29 iOS got a major update with customizable home screens, icon placement, and a new theme engine. 02:54 Customize your home screen with different colors, and change icon and widget colors to match your wallpaper. Other Updates 📊 03:37 Mac mirroring gets a higher resolution, and new tools are available for creating spatial and immersive videos. 04:00 New features include scheduling text messages, text formatting, a game mode that minimizes background activity, and automatic categorization in the new mail app. AirPods and Apple TV Updates 🎧 06:05 AirPods got minor updates, including voice isolation during phone calls, spatial audio during games, and nodding or shaking for responding to prompts. 06:25 Apple TV updates include showing actors' and characters' names on screen and boosting people's voices over the music. iPad OS Updates 📊 06:41 iPad OS allows remote control of someone's iPad with their permission, perfect for family tech support. 07:03 The calculator app on iPad OS is impressive, letting you write equations in handwriting and getting real-time answers. Mac OS Updates 📊 09:40 Mac OS got a new version called Sequoia, featuring automatic window snapping, built-in backgrounds for webcam feeds, and a new password app. Apple Intelligence AI 🤖 10:40 Apple rebranded AI as Apple Intelligence, bringing new generative models and large language models to supported devices. 11:01 Apple Intelligence features include writing tools, a cleanup tool in Photos, and generative emojis. How Apple Handles Complex AI Tasks 💻 15:10 Apple handles most AI tasks on-device, using Apple-built models for faster processing. However, for complex tasks, Apple has two alternative approaches. 15:32 One approach uses a larger server-based model on Apple's Private Cloud compute, ensuring data is not stored or sent to Apple, but may have downsides like slower processing and internet dependence. 15:54 The other approach asks the user for permission to use ChatGPT, allowing access to its capabilities and generating more realistic and varied images. Privacy and Security of AI Features 🔒 16:18 Apple ensures privacy and security by not storing requests, obscuring IP addresses, and preventing OpenAI from forming a profile. All this is done without an account and for free. Insights on Apple's AI Announcements 🤔 17:01 The author believes Apple's AI features are superior, with personalization and existing user info making them more effective. 17:25 The AI announcements overshadow other features, marking a new age for Apple, and the author is excited to explore its capabilities and what it can bring to users.

       "      <td>My takeaway was that across MacOS, iOS and iPadOS I found very few things that I could tell I would include in my daily use. I already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions.  I could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter! I just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro.  This came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\" I already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup.  Apple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels. Softwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works. So, I'm out, except for Mac.</td>\n",

       "      <td>**Lots** of great updates. There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance: 1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri. 2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap. 3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat. 4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.   5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.) 6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.) I get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.</td>\n",

We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 \"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\". Romans 10:13 states \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\". \\r \\r    Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.</td>\n",

P.d. They said thar A17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really? They always said new processors of apple silicon are the most fastest in the world all the time, the processor of the iphone 14 pro max is slow?

       "      <td>My first impression is definitely that they’re playing catch-up, in terms of QoL features. They could’ve done this back in iOS 14 at once, there’s no reason to take 4 years to incorporate all these features. Summarization was already available on Mac, I’ve sent numerous feature requests, asking them to bring it system-wide to iPads and iPhones. This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray. I predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that.  The only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”.  This isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability.  Last time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected.  Furthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac.  - why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing?  Another thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got: - better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago) - Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind.  A few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.</td>\n",

I have a suggestion to take you to a new level. I have been writing Apple for years. I honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. I’ll share them in a moment. By the way I am a software engineer. I am not one who thinks I am so D smart or the smarted person in the room. I love to always learn and ai find I am always learning new things from you. So my idea for you is a real tech news Channel. This will make you something like the Wal Mart of tech news. This idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. I tried to float this to Apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. We have CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iPhone is released. Tech news is happening every day all day. I say join forces with some of the best like yourself, Brian Tong, possibly some from Engadget and create a real Tech News channel. It’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. EVs and Republicans wanting to K EVs, TicTok, Twitter. With social media companies being as influential as they have become. They’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. A real tech news channel will do this. What you and others do is journalism. I want the news to still be fun but I want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a CNN. You will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech CEO’s. It’s a militia billion. Dollar idea I am giving to you. This is something new of its kind and needed. Tech is no longer just mobile. We have stepped into the world of AI and Humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will I pack them. I would love to work with you as a producer or something. I have a huge idea and it will work.</td>\n",

       "1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               My take on WWDC's iPad calculator app: It's nothing more than a gimmick WWDC just dropped yesterday and one of the highlight features was the calculator app feature. MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world. Ok, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks: It’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. You can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly. It can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want. You can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers. The features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools? The first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  In this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. Anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire   That calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad. The second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? Finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. You don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. This reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). It’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. Other examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.   \n",

Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face. ==================================== My requirements for a phone are actually quite simple:  -a camera with acceptable image quality -no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display -stereo front-facing speakers -a headphone jack as backup for when I need it -expandable storage for when I need it -the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS Thus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone. ==================================== Okay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see. ==================================== I honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet. ==================================== I'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.   \n",

How Apple Handles Complex AI Tasks 💻 15:10 Apple handles most AI tasks on-device, using Apple-built models for faster processing. However, for complex tasks, Apple has two alternative approaches. 15:32 One approach uses a larger server-based model on Apple's Private Cloud compute, ensuring data is not stored or sent to Apple, but may have downsides like slower processing and internet dependence. 15:54 The other approach asks the user for permission to use ChatGPT, allowing access to its capabilities and generating more realistic and varied images. Privacy and Security of AI Features 🔒 16:18 Apple ensures privacy and security by not storing requests, obscuring IP addresses, and preventing OpenAI from forming a profile. All this is done without an account and for free.

I already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions.  I could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter! I just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro.  This came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\" I already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup.  Apple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels. Softwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works. So, I'm out, except for Mac.   \n",

There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance: 1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri. 2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap. 3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat. 4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.   5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.) 6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.) I get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.   \n",

We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 \"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\". Romans 10:13 states \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\". \\r \\r    Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.   \n",

                                                           Not only that, for most of the presentation they did say that iphone would have apple intelligence and in the end they said only iphone 15 pro models, is like... 😂 okay apple, not all people can afford a 1100 and 1300 dollars usd smartphones, thanks, steve jobs said that apple is for the humanity and to give them technology to improve people's lifes, apple had vision, tim cook did it until 2018, then everything has go slowly downhill, not all of it of course, but very down, not only that, but jobs said that according to our efforts we decide the price of our products, we try the most to price it correctly, well that was in 2009, and for your knowledge, apple intelligence is only available for 2 iphones (of more than 24 iphones eligible for the ios 18 update *oh is because they don't have 6gb of ram, well darling the Android phone of my Granny costs 200 dollars and has 8gb of ddr4 ram and on screen ai analysis to summarize websites with Gemini for free -well you exchange your data even when they say no but i don't believe any company in terms of 100% privacy so it's meh for me, is logic, that's why USA gov wants to ban TikTok cuz they don't have control over their info and the excuse is that they are \"spies\"-, apple does not use a \"unique physical ram\" to justify their price, like i say.. thefts*) but hey you have good animations :D and \"the ecosystem\" that windows and android are reaching more fast than ever to the point of apple, apple= no moral and respectful for people's money and time (so contrary to Steve's apple), yeah they have good and incredible things like the integration of apple intelligence offline but it doesn't help the fact that whenever they do something great they put it like god's new technology to justify prices in this times when they are not the unique smartphone company they were in 2007-2018, others are in the same level or little lower or little higher than them in terms of technology, i hope that the apple directive is changed but that will not happen because money runs the world and if they are still selling, nothing will change.  P.d. They said thar A17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really? They always said new processors of apple silicon are the most fastest in the world all the time, the processor of the iphone 14 pro max is slow? Gosh they are really inmoral capitalists (i agree with capitalism and liberal economies)   \n",

They could’ve done this back in iOS 14 at once, there’s no reason to take 4 years to incorporate all these features. Summarization was already available on Mac, I’ve sent numerous feature requests, asking them to bring it system-wide to iPads and iPhones. This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray. I predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that.  The only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”.  This isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability.  Last time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected.  Furthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac.  - why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing?  Another thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got: - better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago) - Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind.  A few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.   \n",

Others spend time babbling and trying to be funny and you sound like a tech guy giving us tech news. I have a suggestion to take you to a new level. I have been writing Apple for years. I honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. I’ll share them in a moment. By the way I am a software engineer. I am not one who thinks I am so D smart or the smarted person in the room. I love to always learn and ai find I am always learning new things from you. So my idea for you is a real tech news Channel. This will make you something like the Wal Mart of tech news. This idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. I tried to float this to Apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. We have CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iPhone is released. Tech news is happening every day all day. I say join forces with some of the best like yourself, Brian Tong, possibly some from Engadget and create a real Tech News channel. It’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. EVs and Republicans wanting to K EVs, TicTok, Twitter. With social media companies being as influential as they have become. They’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. A real tech news channel will do this. What you and others do is journalism. I want the news to still be fun but I want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a CNN. You will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech CEO’s. It’s a militia billion. Dollar idea I am giving to you. This is something new of its kind and needed. Tech is no longer just mobile. We have stepped into the world of AI and Humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will I pack them. I would love to work with you as a producer or something. I have a huge idea and it will work.   \n",

       "\"My take on WWDC's iPad calculator app: It's nothing more than a gimmick WWDC just dropped yesterday and one of the highlight features was the calculator app feature. MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world. Ok, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks: It’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. You can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly. It can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want. You can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers. The features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools? The first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  In this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. Anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire   That calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad. The second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? Finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. You don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. This reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). It’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. Other examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.\""

God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\". Romans 10:13 states \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\". \\r \\r    Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away.

Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.</td>\n",

       "      <td>My take on WWDC's iPad calculator app: It's nothing more than a gimmick WWDC just dropped yesterday and one of the highlight features was the calculator app feature. MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world. Ok, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks: It’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. You can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly. It can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want. You can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers. The features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools? The first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  In this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. Anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire   That calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad. The second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? Finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. You don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. This reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). It’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. Other examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Apple's WWDC iPad calculator app is overhyped and lacks real-world practicality. It can give answers as you write down math questions, support variables and equations, and add graphs. While these features are cool, they're easily replaced by better tools and software. In reality, most students don't need this app beyond 4th grade. Math exams require showing working and mental arithmetic, making a physical calculator more effective. The iPad calculator is inferior to more powerful and affordable options like the TI-Nspire. Similarly, adjusting numbers for updated answers or drawing graphs with free software like Geogebra or Desmos can achieve the same results without the need for an iPad.\\n\\nInstead of being impressed by flashy features, we should consider their practicality and potential alternatives. Marketing often conflates a product's usefulness with its engineering complexity, leading to hype around features that are just novelties. The Samsung AI features on my Z Fold 4 are an example of this, promising much but delivering little. We should reflect on how features would be used in real-world scenarios and consider whether they're worth the hype or if cheaper, more effective alternatives exist.</td>\n",

P.d. They said thar A17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really? They always said new processors of apple silicon are the most fastest in the world all the time, the processor of the iphone 14 pro max is slow? Gosh they are really inmoral capitalists (i agree with capitalism and liberal economies)</td>\n",
       "      <td>Apple's recent presentation left me unimpressed. They touted \"Apple Intelligence\" as a key feature, but only for the iPhone 15 Pro models, priced at over $1,100. This is far from Steve Jobs' vision of making technology accessible to humanity. Jobs believed in pricing products correctly, but Apple's prices have become outrageous. I'm not alone in feeling this way, as many Android phones offer more affordable options with similar features. The unique selling point of Apple's offline AI integration isn't enough to justify the high price tag, especially when they claim it's only available on a limited number of devices.\\n\\nApple's shift in strategy is disappointing, and it's hard to reconcile with Steve Jobs' original vision. The iPhone 14 Pro Max's processor is even being criticized as slow, despite Apple's claims of it being the fastest. It's clear that Apple is prioritizing profits over people's needs and financial capabilities. Capitalism is fine, but Apple's greed is not sustainable.</td>\n",

I have a suggestion to take you to a new level. I have been writing Apple for years. I honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. I’ll share them in a moment. By the way I am a software engineer. I am not one who thinks I am so D smart or the smarted person in the room. I love to always learn and ai find I am always learning new things from you. So my idea for you is a real tech news Channel. This will make you something like the Wal Mart of tech news. This idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. I tried to float this to Apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. We have CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iPhone is released. Tech news is happening every day all day. I say join forces with some of the best like yourself, Brian Tong, possibly some from Engadget and create a real Tech News channel. It’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. EVs and Republicans wanting to K EVs, TicTok, Twitter. With social media companies being as influential as they have become. They’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. A real tech news channel will do this. What you and others do is journalism. I want the news to still be fun but I want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a CNN. You will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech CEO’s. It’s a militia billion. Dollar idea I am giving to you. This is something new of its kind and needed. Tech is no longer just mobile. We have stepped into the world of AI and Humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will I pack them. I would love to work with you as a producer or something. I have a huge idea and it will work.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I will never understand these chucklefucks trying to sell VR as a productivity tool at this stage in its development. Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face. ==================================== My requirements for a phone are actually quite simple:  -a camera with acceptable image quality -no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display -stereo front-facing speakers -a headphone jack as backup for when I need it -expandable storage for when I need it -the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS Thus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone. ==================================== Okay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see. ==================================== I honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet. ==================================== I'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.</td>\n",

Unfortunately, few devices meet these requirements, and the iPhone is not one of them.\\n\\nI was impressed by the new calculator app on iPad OS 18, which shows off OCR and AI interpretation well. However, I don't care about AI features, as they often struggle with the complexities of the English language.

They could’ve done this back in iOS 14 at once, there’s no reason to take 4 years to incorporate all these features. Summarization was already available on Mac, I’ve sent numerous feature requests, asking them to bring it system-wide to iPads and iPhones. This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray. I predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that.  The only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”.  This isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability.  Last time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected.  Furthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac.  - why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing?  Another thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got: - better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago) - Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind.  A few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.</td>\n",

I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri. 2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap. 3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat. 4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.   5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.) 6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.) I get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.</td>\n",

       "      <td>My takeaway was that across MacOS, iOS and iPadOS I found very few things that I could tell I would include in my daily use. I already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions.  I could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter! I just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro.  This came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\" I already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup.  Apple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels. Softwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works. So, I'm out, except for Mac.</td>\n",

We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 \"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\". Romans 10:13 states \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\". \\r \\r    Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.   \n",

MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world. Ok, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks: It’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. You can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly. It can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want. You can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers. The features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools? The first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  In this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. Anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire   That calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad. The second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? Finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. You don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. This reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). It’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. Other examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.   \n",

                                                           Not only that, for most of the presentation they did say that iphone would have apple intelligence and in the end they said only iphone 15 pro models, is like... 😂 okay apple, not all people can afford a 1100 and 1300 dollars usd smartphones, thanks, steve jobs said that apple is for the humanity and to give them technology to improve people's lifes, apple had vision, tim cook did it until 2018, then everything has go slowly downhill, not all of it of course, but very down, not only that, but jobs said that according to our efforts we decide the price of our products, we try the most to price it correctly, well that was in 2009, and for your knowledge, apple intelligence is only available for 2 iphones (of more than 24 iphones eligible for the ios 18 update *oh is because they don't have 6gb of ram, well darling the Android phone of my Granny costs 200 dollars and has 8gb of ddr4 ram and on screen ai analysis to summarize websites with Gemini for free -well you exchange your data even when they say no but i don't believe any company in terms of 100% privacy so it's meh for me, is logic, that's why USA gov wants to ban TikTok cuz they don't have control over their info and the excuse is that they are \"spies\"-, apple does not use a \"unique physical ram\" to justify their price, like i say.. thefts*) but hey you have good animations :D and \"the ecosystem\" that windows and android are reaching more fast than ever to the point of apple, apple= no moral and respectful for people's money and time (so contrary to Steve's apple), yeah they have good and incredible things like the integration of apple intelligence offline but it doesn't help the fact that whenever they do something great they put it like god's new technology to justify prices in this times when they are not the unique smartphone company they were in 2007-2018, others are in the same level or little lower or little higher than them in terms of technology, i hope that the apple directive is changed but that will not happen because money runs the world and if they are still selling, nothing will change.  P.d. They said thar A17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really? They always said new processors of apple silicon are the most fastest in the world all the time, the processor of the iphone 14 pro max is slow? Gosh they are really inmoral capitalists (i agree with capitalism and liberal economies)   \n",

Others spend time babbling and trying to be funny and you sound like a tech guy giving us tech news. I have a suggestion to take you to a new level. I have been writing Apple for years. I honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. I’ll share them in a moment. By the way I am a software engineer. I am not one who thinks I am so D smart or the smarted person in the room. I love to always learn and ai find I am always learning new things from you. So my idea for you is a real tech news Channel. This will make you something like the Wal Mart of tech news. This idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. I tried to float this to Apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. We have CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iPhone is released. Tech news is happening every day all day. I say join forces with some of the best like yourself, Brian Tong, possibly some from Engadget and create a real Tech News channel. It’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. EVs and Republicans wanting to K EVs, TicTok, Twitter. With social media companies being as influential as they have become. They’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. A real tech news channel will do this. What you and others do is journalism. I want the news to still be fun but I want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a CNN. You will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech CEO’s. It’s a militia billion. Dollar idea I am giving to you. This is something new of its kind and needed. Tech is no longer just mobile. We have stepped into the world of AI and Humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will I pack them. I would love to work with you as a producer or something. I have a huge idea and it will work.   \n",

Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face. ==================================== My requirements for a phone are actually quite simple:  -a camera with acceptable image quality -no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display -stereo front-facing speakers -a headphone jack as backup for when I need it -expandable storage for when I need it -the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS Thus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone. ==================================== Okay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see. ==================================== I honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet. ==================================== I'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.   \n",

They could’ve done this back in iOS 14 at once, there’s no reason to take 4 years to incorporate all these features. Summarization was already available on Mac, I’ve sent numerous feature requests, asking them to bring it system-wide to iPads and iPhones. This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray. I predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that.  The only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”.  This isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability.  Last time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected.  Furthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac.  - why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing?  Another thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got: - better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago) - Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind.  A few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.   \n",

There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance: 1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri. 2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap. 3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat. 4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.   5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.) 6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.) I get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.   \n",

I already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions.  I could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter! I just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro.  This came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\" I already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup.  Apple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels. Softwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works. So, I'm out, except for Mac.   \n",

Revelation 21:8 describes the second death as a lake of fire and brimstone, where those who reject God will suffer. But God sent Jesus, a perfect sinless sacrifice, to take on our sins and shed his blood on the cross as atonement. Jesus rose from the dead on the 3rd day to show life after death and everlasting life through his sacrifice. John 14:6 says Jesus is the only way to the Father, and Romans 10:13 promises salvation for anyone who calls on the Lord's name. All we need to do is believe Jesus died for our sins and rose from the grave, and ask him to save us from our sins and give us eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free gift from God, but Satan will try to resist us from receiving it. If you're feeling resistance, it's because Satan wants to keep you in eternal punishment in Hell. Hell is no joke - it's eternal torture with no relief. I'm sharing this because I want to spread the message of salvation. There are so many distractions keeping people from thinking about salvation and life after death. Please, ask Jesus to save you from your sins and give you a place in Heaven. He will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.  \n",

It can give answers as you write down math questions, support variables and equations, and add graphs. While these features are cool, they're easily replaced by better tools and software. In reality, most students don't need this app beyond 4th grade. Math exams require showing working and mental arithmetic, making a physical calculator more effective. The iPad calculator is inferior to more powerful and affordable options like the TI-Nspire. Similarly, adjusting numbers for updated answers or drawing graphs with free software like Geogebra or Desmos can achieve the same results without the need for an iPad.\\n\\nInstead of being impressed by flashy features, we should consider their practicality and potential alternatives. Marketing often conflates a product's usefulness with its engineering complexity, leading to hype around features that are just novelties. The Samsung AI features on my Z Fold 4 are an example of this, promising much but delivering little. We should reflect on how features would be used in real-world scenarios and consider whether they're worth the hype or if cheaper, more effective alternatives exist.  \n",

They touted \"Apple Intelligence\" as a key feature, but only for the iPhone 15 Pro models, priced at over $1,100. This is far from Steve Jobs' vision of making technology accessible to humanity. Jobs believed in pricing products correctly, but Apple's prices have become outrageous. I'm not alone in feeling this way, as many Android phones offer more affordable options with similar features. The unique selling point of Apple's offline AI integration isn't enough to justify the high price tag, especially when they claim it's only available on a limited number of devices.\\n\\nApple's shift in strategy is disappointing, and it's hard to reconcile with Steve Jobs' original vision. The iPhone 14 Pro Max's processor is even being criticized as slow, despite Apple's claims of it being the fastest. It's clear that Apple is prioritizing profits over people's needs and financial capabilities. Capitalism is fine, but Apple's greed is not sustainable.  \n",
       "3  Apple's WWDC keynote introduced exciting announcements, including AI surprises in the second half. Vision OS 2.0 brings new features like wrist-turn gestures and quick access to the control center. iOS gets a major update with customizable home screens, icon placement, and a new theme engine. Other updates include scheduling text messages and new tools for creating spatial and immersive videos. AirPods and Apple TV receive minor updates, while iPad OS allows remote control of someone's iPad and features an impressive calculator app. Mac OS gets a new version, Sequoia, with automatic window snapping and built-in backgrounds for webcam feeds. Apple rebranded AI as Apple Intelligence, featuring new generative models and large language models on supported devices. Apple Intelligence includes writing tools, a cleanup tool in Photos, and generative emojis. Apple handles most AI tasks on-device, but uses alternative approaches for complex tasks. The company ensures privacy and security by not storing requests and obscuring IP addresses. I believe Apple's AI features are superior, with personalization and existing user info making them more effective. The AI announcements mark a new age for Apple, and I'm excited to explore its capabilities. I'll create more videos about Apple's AI features and encourage viewers to subscribe for updates.  \n",

As a software engineer, I appreciate how you share tech news in a clear and concise manner. I've been suggesting ideas to Apple, and I believe they've used some of my ideas. I think a real tech news channel would be a great idea, and it could put some influencers out of business. We have mainstream news sources, but tech news is happening every day. I suggest joining forces with other tech experts like Brian Tong and Engadget to create a 24/7 tech news channel. This channel would focus on journalism, providing in-depth interviews and analysis of tech news. It would be fun, but also informative and serious, like CNN. Tech is no longer just about mobile, but also AI and humans. This kind of channel is needed to help people understand the impact of new tech on their lives. I'd love to work with you as a producer to bring this idea to life. I believe it has the potential to be a billion-dollar idea.  \n",
       "5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I'm skeptical about the use of VR headsets as productivity tools due to their heaviness and bulkiness. For VR to be viable, it needs to be more comfortable and compact. My phone requirements are simple: good camera, no notch or hole-punch, stereo speakers, headphone jack, expandable storage, and a custom home screen. Unfortunately, few devices meet these requirements, and the iPhone is not one of them.\\n\\nI was impressed by the new calculator app on iPad OS 18, which shows off OCR and AI interpretation well. However, I don't care about AI features, as they often struggle with the complexities of the English language. Photo editing is a good use case for AI, but it's limited by the quality of the initial photo. I'd rather see AI optimize camera settings to take better photos in the first place.\\n\\nI'm disappointed that Apple didn't announce any updates to their top-of-the-line Mac products, including the M3 or M4 Ultra chip and the next Mac Pro. Content creators reliant on Macs are likely feeling impatient for the next generation of Apple Silicon-powered devices.  \n",
       "6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Apple is playing catch-up with quality of life features, and it's taken them four years to incorporate them into their operating system. Many of these features were already available on Mac, and I've been requesting them for years. Google Photos and Amazon's X-Ray app have had similar features for a while. This year's WWDC showed that the iPad is becoming more powerful, but the Files app needs to be reformed.\\n\\nI'm disappointed that Apple's updates are now mostly incremental, with increasing bugs. They used to focus on improving reliability, but now it seems like they're neglecting the iPad. The new features aren't necessarily unique to the iPad, so I question the value of paying $1000 for an iPad Pro when the $300 iPad can do the same thing.\\n\\nI'm also frustrated that the Mac is getting more attention, with features like better app organization and window management that should have come to the iPad years ago. Quinn from Snazzy Labs recently highlighted this issue, pointing out that Apple is prioritizing iPhone features over iPad needs.  \n",

Other highlights include improved Maps, Mail, and Photos apps, as well as new features like Journal and Game mode.\\n\\nwatchOS 11 introduces Training Mode, reorganizable Fitness app cards, and Cycle Tracking app support. iPadOS gets Redesigned apps, Shareplay drawing features, and a Calculator app. macOS Sequoia adds iPhone mirroring, tiling, and snapping, as well as a Presenter preview and Passwords app.\\n\\nApple also announced Apple Intelligence, a platform for AI-powered writing tools, summarization, and notification management. Siri gets improved language understanding, type-to-Siri functionality, and on-screen awareness. Additionally, Apple revealed ChatGPT 4o, allowing Siri to ask AI-powered questions and generate complex images.  \n",

I'm not a fan of the generative features, which feel like they're taking away from Siri's essential features. I'm looking forward to playing around with the enhanced Siri, though.\\n\\nI'm also not a fan of the color-tinted icons, which feel like a stopgap solution for custom icon support. The new Passwords app is useful for many, but I already use Bitwarden and hope Apple doesn't push their solution.\\n\\nI'm surprised by the blatant ChatGPT branding in the user experience, which feels out of place for Apple. I'm glad they added window snapping, but Stage Manager isn't for me. I'm also concerned about the complexity of the Settings app, which can be overwhelming.\\n\\nAs a software engineer, I'm uncomfortable with feature bloat, but I'm excited to try out the new release.  \n",

I already use 1Password, so Apple Passwords wasn't exciting me. The only feature I'd truly miss from the upcoming updates is improved virtual desktop handling on Mac, which I use daily.\\n\\nI recently traded in my old iPad Pro for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ to get similar features at a lower cost. Apple announced they wouldn't be upgrading my iPad Pro to iOS 18 anyway.\\n\\nI've already moved to Samsung for my phone, and the Galaxy Fold 4 is great because it folds up to be similar in width to my old iPhone 12 Mini. Apple has nothing like this in their lineup.\\n\\nApple's issue is that they make great hardware, but there's little incentive to upgrade. I could easily use an older iPhone, like the iPhone XS, and still have a great experience. The company needs to rethink their upgrade strategy.\\n\\nSamsung's OneUI allows for a high degree of customization, which makes me feel like I have a phone that fits my preferences rather than just adapting to Apple's way of doing things. I'm out as a customer, except for my Macs.  "

God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins.

I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness.

       "      <td>My take on WWDC's iPad calculator app: It's nothing more than a gimmick\\n\\nWWDC just dropped yesterday and one of the highlight features was the calculator app feature. MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world.\\n\\nOk, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks:\\n\\nIt’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question.\\n\\nYou can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly.\\n\\nIt can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want.\\n\\nYou can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers.\\n\\nThe features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools?\\n\\nThe first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic. \\n\\nIn this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer.\\n\\nAnything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire \\n\\n\\nThat calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad.\\n\\nThe second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons?\\n\\nFinally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all.\\n\\nYou don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype.\\n\\nThis reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing).\\n\\nIt’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives.\\n\\nOther examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.</td>\n",

It can give answers as you write down math questions, support variables and equations, and add graphs. While these features are cool, they're easily replaced by better tools and software. In reality, most students don't need this app beyond 4th grade. Math exams require showing working and mental arithmetic, making a physical calculator more effective. The iPad calculator is inferior to more powerful and affordable options like the TI-Nspire. Similarly, adjusting numbers for updated answers or drawing graphs with free software like Geogebra or Desmos can achieve the same results without the need for an iPad. Instead of being impressed by flashy features, we should consider their practicality and potential alternatives. Marketing often conflates a product's usefulness with its engineering complexity, leading to hype around features that are just novelties. The Samsung AI features on my Z Fold 4 are an example of this, promising much but delivering little. We should reflect on how features would be used in real-world scenarios and consider whether they're worth the hype or if cheaper, more effective alternatives exist.</td>\n",

They said thar A17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really? They always said new processors of apple silicon are the most fastest in the world all the time, the processor of the iphone 14 pro max is slow?

       "      <td>Apple's recent presentation left me unimpressed. They touted \"Apple Intelligence\" as a key feature, but only for the iPhone 15 Pro models, priced at over $1,100. This is far from Steve Jobs' vision of making technology accessible to humanity. Jobs believed in pricing products correctly, but Apple's prices have become outrageous. I'm not alone in feeling this way, as many Android phones offer more affordable options with similar features. The unique selling point of Apple's offline AI integration isn't enough to justify the high price tag, especially when they claim it's only available on a limited number of devices. Apple's shift in strategy is disappointing, and it's hard to reconcile with Steve Jobs' original vision. The iPhone 14 Pro Max's processor is even being criticized as slow, despite Apple's claims of it being the fastest. It's clear that Apple is prioritizing profits over people's needs and financial capabilities. Capitalism is fine, but Apple's greed is not sustainable.</td>\n",

By the way I am a software engineer. I am not one who thinks I am so D smart or the smarted person in the room. I love to always learn and ai find I am always learning new things from you. So my idea for you is a real tech news Channel. This will make you something like the Wal Mart of tech news. This idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. I tried to float this to Apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. We have CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iPhone is released. Tech news is happening every day all day. I say join forces with some of the best like yourself, Brian Tong, possibly some from Engadget and create a real Tech News channel. It’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. EVs and Republicans wanting to K EVs, TicTok, Twitter. With social media companies being as influential as they have become. They’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. A real tech news channel will do this. What you and others do is journalism. I want the news to still be fun but I want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a CNN. You will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech CEO’s. It’s a militia billion. Dollar idea I am giving to you. This is something new of its kind and needed. Tech is no longer just mobile. We have stepped into the world of AI and Humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will I pack them. I would love to work with you as a producer or something. I have a huge idea and it will work.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I will never understand these chucklefucks trying to sell VR as a productivity tool at this stage in its development. Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face.\\n====================================\\nMy requirements for a phone are actually quite simple: \\n-a camera with acceptable image quality\\n-no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display\\n-stereo front-facing speakers\\n-a headphone jack as backup for when I need it\\n-expandable storage for when I need it\\n-the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS\\n\\nThus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone.\\n====================================\\nOkay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see.\\n====================================\\nI honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet.\\n====================================\\nI'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I'm skeptical about the use of VR headsets as productivity tools due to their heaviness and bulkiness. For VR to be viable, it needs to be more comfortable and compact. My phone requirements are simple: good camera, no notch or hole-punch, stereo speakers, headphone jack, expandable storage, and a custom home screen. Unfortunately, few devices meet these requirements, and the iPhone is not one of them. I was impressed by the new calculator app on iPad OS 18, which shows off OCR and AI interpretation well. However, I don't care about AI features, as they often struggle with the complexities of the English language. Photo editing is a good use case for AI, but it's limited by the quality of the initial photo. I'd rather see AI optimize camera settings to take better photos in the first place. I'm disappointed that Apple didn't announce any updates to their top-of-the-line Mac products, including the M3 or M4 Ultra chip and the next Mac Pro. Content creators reliant on Macs are likely feeling impatient for the next generation of Apple Silicon-powered devices.</td>\n",

This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray.\\n\\nI predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that. \\n\\nThe only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”. \\n\\nThis isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability. \\nLast time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected. \\nFurthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac. \\n- why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing? \\nAnother thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got:\\n- better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago)\\n- Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind. \\n\\nA few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.</td>\n",

Many of these features were already available on Mac, and I've been requesting them for years. Google Photos and Amazon's X-Ray app have had similar features for a while. This year's WWDC showed that the iPad is becoming more powerful, but the Files app needs to be reformed. I'm disappointed that Apple's updates are now mostly incremental, with increasing bugs. They used to focus on improving reliability, but now it seems like they're neglecting the iPad. The new features aren't necessarily unique to the iPad, so I question the value of paying $1000 for an iPad Pro when the $300 iPad can do the same thing. I'm also frustrated that the Mac is getting more attention, with features like better app organization and window management that should have come to the iPad years ago.

I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri.\\n2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap.\\n3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat.\\n4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.  \\n5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.)\\n6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.)\\n\\nI get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.</td>\n",

I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions. \\n\\nI could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter!\\n\\nI just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro. \\n\\nThis came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\"\\n\\nI already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup. \\n\\nApple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels.\\n\\nSoftwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works.\\n\\nSo, I'm out, except for Mac.</td>\n",

The only feature I'd truly miss from the upcoming updates is improved virtual desktop handling on Mac, which I use daily. I recently traded in my old iPad Pro for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ to get similar features at a lower cost. Apple announced they wouldn't be upgrading my iPad Pro to iOS 18 anyway. I've already moved to Samsung for my phone, and the Galaxy Fold 4 is great because it folds up to be similar in width to my old iPhone 12 Mini. Apple has nothing like this in their lineup. Apple's issue is that they make great hardware, but there's little incentive to upgrade. I could easily use an older iPhone, like the iPhone XS, and still have a great experience. The company needs to rethink their upgrade strategy. Samsung's OneUI allows for a high degree of customization, which makes me feel like I have a phone that fits my preferences rather than just adapting to Apple's way of doing things.

I use Bitwarden. If they just plug into the existing extensibility model, and this new app is treated the same as a third-party option, then I’m happy.   \n",

We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 \"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\". Romans 10:13 states \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\". \\r\\n\\r\\n   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.   \n",

MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world.\\n\\nOk, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks:\\n\\nIt’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question.\\n\\nYou can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly.\\n\\nIt can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want.\\n\\nYou can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers.\\n\\nThe features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools?\\n\\nThe first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic. \\n\\nIn this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer.\\n\\nAnything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire \\n\\n\\nThat calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad.\\n\\nThe second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons?\\n\\nFinally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all.\\n\\nYou don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype.\\n\\nThis reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing).\\n\\nIt’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives.\\n\\nOther examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.   \n",

intelligence and in the end they said only iphone 15 pro models, is like... 😂 okay apple, not all people can afford a 1100 and 1300 dollars usd smartphones, thanks, steve jobs said that apple is for the humanity and to give them technology to improve people's lifes, apple had vision, tim cook did it until 2018, then everything has go slowly downhill, not all of it of course, but very down, not only that, but jobs said that according to our efforts we decide the price of our products, we try the most to price it correctly, well that was in 2009, and for your knowledge, apple intelligence is only available for 2 iphones (of more than 24 iphones eligible for the ios 18 update *oh is because they don't have 6gb of ram, well darling the Android phone of my Granny costs 200 dollars and has 8gb of ddr4 ram and on screen ai analysis to summarize websites with Gemini for free -well you exchange your data even when they say no but i don't believe any company in terms of 100% privacy so it's meh for me, is logic, that's why USA gov wants to ban TikTok cuz they don't have control over their info and the excuse is that they are \"spies\"-, apple does not use a \"unique physical ram\" to justify their price, like i say.. thefts*) but hey you have good animations :D and \"the ecosystem\" that windows and android are reaching more fast than ever to the point of apple, apple= no moral and respectful for people's money and time (so contrary to Steve's apple), yeah they have good and incredible things like the integration of apple intelligence offline but it doesn't help the fact that whenever they do something great they put it like god's new technology to justify prices in this times when they are not the unique smartphone company they were in 2007-2018, others are in the same level or little lower or little higher than them in terms of technology, i hope that the apple directive is changed but that will not happen because money runs the world and if they are still selling, nothing will change. \\n\\nP.d. They said thar A17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really? They always said new processors of apple silicon are the most fastest in the world all the time, the processor of the iphone 14 pro max is slow? Gosh they are really inmoral capitalists (i agree with capitalism and liberal economies)   \n",

Others spend time babbling and trying to be funny and you sound like a tech guy giving us tech news. I have a suggestion to take you to a new level. I have been writing Apple for years. I honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. I’ll share them in a moment. By the way I am a software engineer. I am not one who thinks I am so D smart or the smarted person in the room. I love to always learn and ai find I am always learning new things from you. So my idea for you is a real tech news Channel. This will make you something like the Wal Mart of tech news. This idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. I tried to float this to Apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. We have CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iPhone is released. Tech news is happening every day all day. I say join forces with some of the best like yourself, Brian Tong, possibly some from Engadget and create a real Tech News channel. It’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. EVs and Republicans wanting to K EVs, TicTok, Twitter. With social media companies being as influential as they have become. They’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. A real tech news channel will do this. What you and others do is journalism. I want the news to still be fun but I want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a CNN. You will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech CEO’s. It’s a militia billion. Dollar idea I am giving to you. This is something new of its kind and needed. Tech is no longer just mobile. We have stepped into the world of AI and Humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will I pack them. I would love to work with you as a producer or something. I have a huge idea and it will work.   \n",

Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face.\\n====================================\\nMy requirements for a phone are actually quite simple: \\n-a camera with acceptable image quality\\n-no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display\\n-stereo front-facing speakers\\n-a headphone jack as backup for when I need it\\n-expandable storage for when I need it\\n-the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS\\n\\nThus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone.\\n====================================\\nOkay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see.\\n====================================\\nI honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet.\\n====================================\\nI'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.   \n",

This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray.\\n\\nI predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that. \\n\\nThe only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”. \\n\\nThis isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability. \\nLast time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected. \\nFurthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac. \\n- why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing? \\nAnother thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got:\\n- better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago)\\n- Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind. \\n\\nA few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.   \n",

There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance:\\n\\n1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri.\\n2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap.\\n3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat.\\n4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.  \\n5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.)\\n6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.)\\n\\nI get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.   \n",

I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions. \\n\\nI could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter!\\n\\nI just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro. \\n\\nThis came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\"\\n\\nI already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup. \\n\\nApple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels.\\n\\nSoftwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works.\\n\\nSo, I'm out, except for Mac.   \n",

Revelation 21:8 describes the second death as a lake of fire and brimstone, where those who reject God will suffer. But God sent Jesus, a perfect sinless sacrifice, to take on our sins and shed his blood on the cross as atonement. Jesus rose from the dead on the 3rd day to show life after death and everlasting life through his sacrifice. John 14:6 says Jesus is the only way to the Father, and Romans 10:13 promises salvation for anyone who calls on the Lord's name. All we need to do is believe Jesus died for our sins and rose from the grave, and ask him to save us from our sins and give us eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free gift from God, but Satan will try to resist us from receiving it. If you're feeling resistance, it's because Satan wants to keep you in eternal punishment in Hell. Hell is no joke - it's eternal torture with no relief. I'm sharing this because I want to spread the message of salvation. There are so many distractions keeping people from thinking about salvation and life after death. Please, ask Jesus to save you from your sins and give you a place in Heaven. He will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.  \n",

It can give answers as you write down math questions, support variables and equations, and add graphs. While these features are cool, they're easily replaced by better tools and software. In reality, most students don't need this app beyond 4th grade. Math exams require showing working and mental arithmetic, making a physical calculator more effective. The iPad calculator is inferior to more powerful and affordable options like the TI-Nspire. Similarly, adjusting numbers for updated answers or drawing graphs with free software like Geogebra or Desmos can achieve the same results without the need for an iPad. Instead of being impressed by flashy features, we should consider their practicality and potential alternatives. Marketing often conflates a product's usefulness with its engineering complexity, leading to hype around features that are just novelties. The Samsung AI features on my Z Fold 4 are an example of this, promising much but delivering little. We should reflect on how features would be used in real-world scenarios and consider whether they're worth the hype or if cheaper, more effective alternatives exist.  \n",

They touted \"Apple Intelligence\" as a key feature, but only for the iPhone 15 Pro models, priced at over $1,100. This is far from Steve Jobs' vision of making technology accessible to humanity. Jobs believed in pricing products correctly, but Apple's prices have become outrageous. I'm not alone in feeling this way, as many Android phones offer more affordable options with similar features. The unique selling point of Apple's offline AI integration isn't enough to justify the high price tag, especially when they claim it's only available on a limited number of devices. Apple's shift in strategy is disappointing, and it's hard to reconcile with Steve Jobs' original vision. The iPhone 14 Pro Max's processor is even being criticized as slow, despite Apple's claims of it being the fastest. It's clear that Apple is prioritizing profits over people's needs and financial capabilities. Capitalism is fine, but Apple's greed is not sustainable.  \n",
       "8   Apple's WWDC keynote introduced exciting announcements, including AI surprises in the second half. Vision OS 2.0 brings new features like wrist-turn gestures and quick access to the control center. iOS gets a major update with customizable home screens, icon placement, and a new theme engine. Other updates include scheduling text messages and new tools for creating spatial and immersive videos. AirPods and Apple TV receive minor updates, while iPad OS allows remote control of someone's iPad and features an impressive calculator app. Mac OS gets a new version, Sequoia, with automatic window snapping and built-in backgrounds for webcam feeds. Apple rebranded AI as Apple Intelligence, featuring new generative models and large language models on supported devices. Apple Intelligence includes writing tools, a cleanup tool in Photos, and generative emojis. Apple handles most AI tasks on-device, but uses alternative approaches for complex tasks. The company ensures privacy and security by not storing requests and obscuring IP addresses. I believe Apple's AI features are superior, with personalization and existing user info making them more effective. The AI announcements mark a new age for Apple, and I'm excited to explore its capabilities. I'll create more videos about Apple's AI features and encourage viewers to subscribe for updates.  \n",

As a software engineer, I appreciate how you share tech news in a clear and concise manner. I've been suggesting ideas to Apple, and I believe they've used some of my ideas. I think a real tech news channel would be a great idea, and it could put some influencers out of business. We have mainstream news sources, but tech news is happening every day. I suggest joining forces with other tech experts like Brian Tong and Engadget to create a 24/7 tech news channel. This channel would focus on journalism, providing in-depth interviews and analysis of tech news. It would be fun, but also informative and serious, like CNN. Tech is no longer just about mobile, but also AI and humans. This kind of channel is needed to help people understand the impact of new tech on their lives. I'd love to work with you as a producer to bring this idea to life. I believe it has the potential to be a billion-dollar idea.  \n",

For VR to be viable, it needs to be more comfortable and compact. My phone requirements are simple: good camera, no notch or hole-punch, stereo speakers, headphone jack, expandable storage, and a custom home screen. Unfortunately, few devices meet these requirements, and the iPhone is not one of them. I was impressed by the new calculator app on iPad OS 18, which shows off OCR and AI interpretation well. However, I don't care about AI features, as they often struggle with the complexities of the English language. Photo editing is a good use case for AI, but it's limited by the quality of the initial photo. I'd rather see AI optimize camera settings to take better photos in the first place. I'm disappointed that Apple didn't announce any updates to their top-of-the-line Mac products, including the M3 or M4 Ultra chip and the next Mac Pro. Content creators reliant on Macs are likely feeling impatient for the next generation of Apple Silicon-powered devices.  \n",

Many of these features were already available on Mac, and I've been requesting them for years. Google Photos and Amazon's X-Ray app have had similar features for a while. This year's WWDC showed that the iPad is becoming more powerful, but the Files app needs to be reformed. I'm disappointed that Apple's updates are now mostly incremental, with increasing bugs. They used to focus on improving reliability, but now it seems like they're neglecting the iPad. The new features aren't necessarily unique to the iPad, so I question the value of paying $1000 for an iPad Pro when the $300 iPad can do the same thing. I'm also frustrated that the Mac is getting more attention, with features like better app organization and window management that should have come to the iPad years ago. Quinn from Snazzy Labs recently highlighted this issue, pointing out that Apple is prioritizing iPhone features over iPad needs.  \n",

I'm not a fan of the generative features, which feel like they're taking away from Siri's essential features. I'm looking forward to playing around with the enhanced Siri, though. I'm also not a fan of the color-tinted icons, which feel like a stopgap solution for custom icon support. The new Passwords app is useful for many, but I already use Bitwarden and hope Apple doesn't push their solution. I'm surprised by the blatant ChatGPT branding in the user experience, which feels out of place for Apple. I'm glad they added window snapping, but Stage Manager isn't for me. I'm also concerned about the complexity of the Settings app, which can be overwhelming. As a software engineer, I'm uncomfortable with feature bloat, but I'm excited to try out the new release.  \n",

I already use 1Password, so Apple Passwords wasn't exciting me. The only feature I'd truly miss from the upcoming updates is improved virtual desktop handling on Mac, which I use daily. I recently traded in my old iPad Pro for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ to get similar features at a lower cost. Apple announced they wouldn't be upgrading my iPad Pro to iOS 18 anyway. I've already moved to Samsung for my phone, and the Galaxy Fold 4 is great because it folds up to be similar in width to my old iPhone 12 Mini. Apple has nothing like this in their lineup. Apple's issue is that they make great hardware, but there's little incentive to upgrade. I could easily use an older iPhone, like the iPhone XS, and still have a great experience. The company needs to rethink their upgrade strategy. Samsung's OneUI allows for a high degree of customization, which makes me feel like I have a phone that fits my preferences rather than just adapting to Apple's way of doing things. I'm out as a customer, except for my Macs.  "

       "      <td>I will never understand these chucklefucks trying to sell VR as a productivity tool at this stage in its development. Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face.\\n====================================\\nMy requirements for a phone are actually quite simple: \\n-a camera with acceptable image quality\\n-no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display\\n-stereo front-facing speakers\\n-a headphone jack as backup for when I need it\\n-expandable storage for when I need it\\n-the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS\\n\\nThus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone.\\n====================================\\nOkay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see.\\n====================================\\nI honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet.\\n====================================\\nI'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I'm skeptical about the use of VR headsets as productivity tools due to their heaviness and bulkiness. For VR to be viable, it needs to be more comfortable and compact. My phone requirements are simple: good camera, no notch or hole-punch, stereo speakers, headphone jack, expandable storage, and a custom home screen. Unfortunately, few devices meet these requirements, and the iPhone is not one of them. I was impressed by the new calculator app on iPad OS 18, which shows off OCR and AI interpretation well. However, I don't care about AI features, as they often struggle with the complexities of the English language. Photo editing is a good use case for AI, but it's limited by the quality of the initial photo. I'd rather see AI optimize camera settings to take better photos in the first place. I'm disappointed that Apple didn't announce any updates to their top-of-the-line Mac products, including the M3 or M4 Ultra chip and the next Mac Pro.

       "      <td>My first impression is definitely that they’re playing catch-up, in terms of QoL features.\\n\\nThey could’ve done this back in iOS 14 at once, there’s no reason to take 4 years to incorporate all these features.\\n\\nSummarization was already available on Mac, I’ve sent numerous feature requests, asking them to bring it system-wide to iPads and iPhones. This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray.\\n\\nI predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that. \\n\\nThe only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”. \\n\\nThis isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability. \\nLast time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected. \\nFurthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac. \\n- why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing? \\nAnother thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got:\\n- better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago)\\n- Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind. \\n\\nA few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.</td>\n",

Many of these features were already available on Mac, and I've been requesting them for years. Google Photos and Amazon's X-Ray app have had similar features for a while. This year's WWDC showed that the iPad is becoming more powerful, but the Files app needs to be reformed. I'm disappointed that Apple's updates are now mostly incremental, with increasing bugs. They used to focus on improving reliability, but now it seems like they're neglecting the iPad. The new features aren't necessarily unique to the iPad, so I question the value of paying $1000 for an iPad Pro when the $300 iPad can do the same thing. I'm also frustrated that the Mac is getting more attention, with features like better app organization and window management that should have come to the iPad years ago.

       "      <td>**Lots** of great updates. There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance:\\n\\n1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri.\\n2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap.\\n3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat.\\n4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.  \\n5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.)\\n6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.)\\n\\nI get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.</td>\n",

I'm also not a fan of the color-tinted icons, which feel like a stopgap solution for custom icon support.

       "      <td>My takeaway was that across MacOS, iOS and iPadOS I found very few things that I could tell I would include in my daily use.\\n\\nI already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions. \\n\\nI could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter!\\n\\nI just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro. \\n\\nThis came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\"\\n\\nI already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup. \\n\\nApple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels.\\n\\nSoftwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works.\\n\\nSo, I'm out, except for Mac.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I was underwhelmed by Apple's latest updates across all their platforms. I already use 1Password, so Apple Passwords wasn't exciting me. The only feature I'd truly miss from the upcoming updates is improved virtual desktop handling on Mac, which I use daily. I recently traded in my old iPad Pro for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ to get similar features at a lower cost. Apple announced they wouldn't be upgrading my iPad Pro to iOS 18 anyway. I've already moved to Samsung for my phone, and the Galaxy Fold 4 is great because it folds up to be similar in width to my old iPhone 12 Mini. Apple has nothing like this in their lineup. Apple's issue is that they make great hardware, but there's little incentive to upgrade. I could easily use an older iPhone, like the iPhone XS, and still have a great experience. The company needs to rethink their upgrade strategy. Samsung's OneUI allows for a high degree of customization, which makes me feel like I have a phone that fits my preferences rather than just adapting to Apple's way of doing things. I'm out as a customer, except for my Macs.</td>\n",

Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face.\\n====================================\\nMy requirements for a phone are actually quite simple: \\n-a camera with acceptable image quality\\n-no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display\\n-stereo front-facing speakers\\n-a headphone jack as backup for when I need it\\n-expandable storage for when I need it\\n-the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS\\n\\nThus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone.\\n====================================\\nOkay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see.\\n====================================\\nI honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet.\\n====================================\\nI'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.   \n",

This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray.\\n\\nI predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that. \\n\\nThe only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”. \\n\\nThis isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability. \\nLast time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected. \\nFurthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac. \\n- why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing? \\nAnother thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got:\\n- better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago)\\n- Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind. \\n\\nA few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.   \n",

There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance:\\n\\n1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri.\\n2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap.\\n3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat.\\n4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.  \\n5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.)\\n6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.)\\n\\nI get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.   \n",

I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions. \\n\\nI could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter!\\n\\nI just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro. \\n\\nThis came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\"\\n\\nI already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup. \\n\\nApple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels.\\n\\nSoftwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works.\\n\\nSo, I'm out, except for Mac.   \n",

       "11662               I'm skeptical about the use of VR headsets as productivity tools due to their heaviness and bulkiness. For VR to be viable, it needs to be more comfortable and compact. My phone requirements are simple: good camera, no notch or hole-punch, stereo speakers, headphone jack, expandable storage, and a custom home screen. Unfortunately, few devices meet these requirements, and the iPhone is not one of them. I was impressed by the new calculator app on iPad OS 18, which shows off OCR and AI interpretation well. However, I don't care about AI features, as they often struggle with the complexities of the English language. Photo editing is a good use case for AI, but it's limited by the quality of the initial photo. I'd rather see AI optimize camera settings to take better photos in the first place. I'm disappointed that Apple didn't announce any updates to their top-of-the-line Mac products, including the M3 or M4 Ultra chip and the next Mac Pro. Content creators reliant on Macs are likely feeling impatient for the next generation of Apple Silicon-powered devices.   \n",
       "11663                                      Apple is playing catch-up with quality of life features, and it's taken them four years to incorporate them into their operating system. Many of these features were already available on Mac, and I've been requesting them for years. Google Photos and Amazon's X-Ray app have had similar features for a while. This year's WWDC showed that the iPad is becoming more powerful, but the Files app needs to be reformed. I'm disappointed that Apple's updates are now mostly incremental, with increasing bugs. They used to focus on improving reliability, but now it seems like they're neglecting the iPad. The new features aren't necessarily unique to the iPad, so I question the value of paying $1000 for an iPad Pro when the $300 iPad can do the same thing. I'm also frustrated that the Mac is getting more attention, with features like better app organization and window management that should have come to the iPad years ago. Quinn from Snazzy Labs recently highlighted this issue, pointing out that Apple is prioritizing iPhone features over iPad needs.   \n",

VisionOS 2 features 2k native apps, Photos with ML-powered 3D spatial photos, and Shareplay with a quick access hand gesture menu. iOS 18 brings a customizable Home Screen, new Control Center features, and Secure Bluetooth pairing. Other highlights include improved Maps, Mail, and Photos apps, as well as new features like Journal and Game mode. watchOS 11 introduces Training Mode, reorganizable Fitness app cards, and Cycle Tracking app support. iPadOS gets Redesigned apps, Shareplay drawing features, and a Calculator app. macOS Sequoia adds iPhone mirroring, tiling, and snapping, as well as a Presenter preview and Passwords app. Apple also announced Apple Intelligence, a platform for AI-powered writing tools, summarization, and notification management. Siri gets improved language understanding, type-to-Siri functionality, and on-screen awareness. Additionally, Apple revealed ChatGPT 4o, allowing Siri to ask AI-powered questions and generate complex images.   \n",

I'm not a fan of the generative features, which feel like they're taking away from Siri's essential features. I'm looking forward to playing around with the enhanced Siri, though. I'm also not a fan of the color-tinted icons, which feel like a stopgap solution for custom icon support. The new Passwords app is useful for many, but I already use Bitwarden and hope Apple doesn't push their solution. I'm surprised by the blatant ChatGPT branding in the user experience, which feels out of place for Apple. I'm glad they added window snapping, but Stage Manager isn't for me. I'm also concerned about the complexity of the Settings app, which can be overwhelming. As a software engineer, I'm uncomfortable with feature bloat, but I'm excited to try out the new release.   \n",
       "11666  I was underwhelmed by Apple's latest updates across all their platforms. I already use 1Password, so Apple Passwords wasn't exciting me. The only feature I'd truly miss from the upcoming updates is improved virtual desktop handling on Mac, which I use daily. I recently traded in my old iPad Pro for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ to get similar features at a lower cost. Apple announced they wouldn't be upgrading my iPad Pro to iOS 18 anyway. I've already moved to Samsung for my phone, and the Galaxy Fold 4 is great because it folds up to be similar in width to my old iPhone 12 Mini. Apple has nothing like this in their lineup. Apple's issue is that they make great hardware, but there's little incentive to upgrade. I could easily use an older iPhone, like the iPhone XS, and still have a great experience. The company needs to rethink their upgrade strategy. Samsung's OneUI allows for a high degree of customization, which makes me feel like I have a phone that fits my preferences rather than just adapting to Apple's way of doing things. I'm out as a customer, except for my Macs.   \n",
