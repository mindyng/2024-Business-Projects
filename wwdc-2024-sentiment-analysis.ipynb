There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance:\\n\\n1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri.\\n2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap.\\n3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat.\\n4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.  \\n5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.)\\n6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.)\\n\\nI get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[My main problem with apple products is how they have all these cool features that you would literally never know about just by looking at the product\\n\\nAll these features are buried under gestures and just non-intuitive things that you would never do if you didn't know the feature was there. \\n\\nLike you gotta know to randomly swipe down during a TV show to get info about the TV show. There isn't like a \"button\" that is labeled \"info\" that tells the user who doesn't know how to get to the info what to do. \\n\\nAnd at this point it seems like there are literally MILLIONS of little features like this baked into all the different platforms. \\n\\nIt's cool and easy to use if you're educated about how to use the products but if you're a beginner without an instruction manual how does apple expect anyone to figure all this stuff out?, Apple might always be late to the game with features but you know you're gonna get the best version of those features when Apple do it, My latest computer cost $40.  I bought an SSD for $20 and loaded it with Linux.  I suppose some people really need the \"latest and greatest\".  But I don't.  In about 16 months the \"used computer\" market will be FLOODED because Windows 10 will no longer be supported and Windows 11 needs new hardware.  It's a great time to buy used tech.]</td>\n",

       "0    [Make a video of what's new on iPhones that's already been there on Android phones 😁, Marques, type to Siri is not a new feature on iOS!😂\\nI’ve been using type to Siri for 5 plus years now!😂, **Lots** of great updates. There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance:\\n\\n1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri.\\n2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap.\\n3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat.\\n4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.  \\n5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.)\\n6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.)\\n\\nI get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.]  \n",

There isn't like a \"button\" that is labeled \"info\" that tells the user who doesn't know how to get to the info what to do. \\n\\nAnd at this point it seems like there are literally MILLIONS of little features like this baked into all the different platforms. \\n\\nIt's cool and easy to use if you're educated about how to use the products but if you're a beginner without an instruction manual how does apple expect anyone to figure all this stuff out?, Apple might always be late to the game with features but you know you're gonna get the best version of those features when Apple do it, My latest computer cost $40.  I bought an SSD for $20 and loaded it with Linux.  I suppose some people really need the \"latest and greatest\".  But I don't.  In about 16 months the \"used computer\" market will be FLOODED because Windows 10 will no longer be supported and Windows 11 needs new hardware.  It's a great time to buy used tech.]  \n",

If I wanted it, I’d buy an android🤷🏾‍♀️, AI = Apple intelligence., The \"calculator\" is pretty cool demo. But I'm going to wait until I see people use it before I go \"hey, I want that on my Android stuff\". Because the last time Apple said \"we can do handwriting recognition and stuff\" as an actual demo instead of rattling off features was... the Apple Newton. I'm still torn on AI in general, but that's not something to writeup here. I'm very glad they are going in on \"yea, this stays on device and we'll ask if you want to go off device\". I can't say I believe the \"private compute\" stuff but I'm sure someone will hook up some packet sniffing thing and work their way through as many features as they can and see at what point it starts talking to the internet.\\n\\nI do have to take issue with one comment that was said... \"they tried to say everything except AI, so they said machine learning and...\" 99% of what people see today, even OpenAI's ChatGPT, is machine learning. Nothing is \"intelligent\" here or from Google or Microsoft or OpenAI. Not only are their papers talking about \"AI hallucinations\" which give the appearance of intelligence without it being there, but there are enough limitations on how things are done that it's unlikely much outside of the many demos that get shown will function the way people expect. As someone on the internet said \"AI = what makes NPCs in video games do things and AI = complex scientific models... AI = non-generative tools to automate... AI = generative tools... it feels like deliberate obfuscation calling everything AI\" but I can tell you... some board members are thrilled about the money their making from the naming.]</td>\n",

By default (when using OpenAI) it will use the latest GPT-4o for free and paid users. If you have a paid account, you can sign in and get access to paid features.\\n\\nThis is actually quite vague because the paid features are not overly separated anymore but more specifically the top paid feature is voice chat which was not mentioned so I’m not sure what exactly they mean.\\n\\nI imagine message limits to 4o will still be throttled for free users and they’ll drop down to GPT-3.5(???) but that was very unclear. In fact I’m actually not even sure why they’d mention the sign in unless theres something we don’t know. Because all users get access to most of the same 4o features whether free or paid so I’m not seeing the direct “oh that’s great to hear” about that\\n\\nEdit: I just did a lot of yapping but in summary. Both get access to 4o for free, you can sign in ti access pairs features but the only paid features 4o has were not mentioned at all in the keynote as being a possibility—maybe when September comes, I understood it as you could \"plug in\" your paid Chat-GPT account and use that but by default they use whatever free version of Chat-GPT is available.]</td>\n",

We have the sizes of the devices optimized but soon we will see it able to do more.  That is why it is not artificial intelligence because it is about integrating into the filter of apple's devices and capabilities.  Rabbit is poorly designed and cannot improve itself because it lacks the ability to provide feedback to the AI.  When they design the products and services including apple, there has to be at least 2 options to where it can tailor solutions to it unless there is a certain solution like in maths as the best feedback is that it is wrong.  If there is an idiocracy movie, it is that we all become so reliant on AI that no one checks the answer to a math problem and everyone just takes AI's word for it and the math problem is completely wrong.  That is a problem., I actually appreciate that Apple refuses to call this technology \"A.I.\", because it definitively, unequivocably is *not* \"artificial intelligence\". I'm not saying the technology isn't interesting and potentially useful (if implemented ethically, which currently none of it is), but it's not \"A.I.\" It shows a streak of integrity from Apple that they would not succumb to marketing hype to literally lie to people about the tech.\\n\\nI'm also impressed that they managed to find a marketing spin that allowed them to draw in all the folks who've fallen for the false terminology while still creating a phrase that doesn't, technically, call it \"artificial intelligence\".\\n\\nI genuinely wish Silicon Valley would just drop \"A.I.\" from its spin machine and get another name for this tech, so it stops getting conflated with the actual science of developing true A.I., It is mildly pleasing that Apple seems to know the difference between artificial intelligence and machine \"learning\". However, being clever at marketing it uses its brand name, beginning with 'A' and links it the broad term \"intelligence\".\\nThus, the craze for muddled ideas about what AI is, in strict definitions, can continue and Apple gets to claim a slice of the whole shebang with clever electronics seeming to be new when they are really extensions/evolution of machine \"learning\". \\nThere is no dishonesty, merely more colorful and responsive fog and a significant step forward to the demise of x-86.]</td>\n",

If I wanted it, I’d buy an android🤷🏾‍♀️, AI = Apple intelligence., The \"calculator\" is pretty cool demo. But I'm going to wait until I see people use it before I go \"hey, I want that on my Android stuff\". Because the last time Apple said \"we can do handwriting recognition and stuff\" as an actual demo instead of rattling off features was... the Apple Newton. I'm still torn on AI in general, but that's not something to writeup here. I'm very glad they are going in on \"yea, this stays on device and we'll ask if you want to go off device\". I can't say I believe the \"private compute\" stuff but I'm sure someone will hook up some packet sniffing thing and work their way through as many features as they can and see at what point it starts talking to the internet.\\n\\nI do have to take issue with one comment that was said... \"they tried to say everything except AI, so they said machine learning and...\" 99% of what people see today, even OpenAI's ChatGPT, is machine learning. Nothing is \"intelligent\" here or from Google or Microsoft or OpenAI. Not only are their papers talking about \"AI hallucinations\" which give the appearance of intelligence without it being there, but there are enough limitations on how things are done that it's unlikely much outside of the many demos that get shown will function the way people expect. As someone on the internet said \"AI = what makes NPCs in video games do things and AI = complex scientific models... AI = non-generative tools to automate...

By default (when using OpenAI) it will use the latest GPT-4o for free and paid users. If you have a paid account, you can sign in and get access to paid features.\\n\\nThis is actually quite vague because the paid features are not overly separated anymore but more specifically the top paid feature is voice chat which was not mentioned so I’m not sure what exactly they mean.\\n\\nI imagine message limits to 4o will still be throttled for free users and they’ll drop down to GPT-3.5(???) but that was very unclear. In fact I’m actually not even sure why they’d mention the sign in unless theres something we don’t know. Because all users get access to most of the same 4o features whether free or paid so I’m not seeing the direct “oh that’s great to hear” about that\\n\\nEdit: I just did a lot of yapping but in summary. Both get access to 4o for free, you can sign in ti access pairs features but the only paid features 4o has were not mentioned at all in the keynote as being a possibility—maybe when September comes, I understood it as you could \"plug in\" your paid Chat-GPT account and use that but by default they use whatever free version of Chat-GPT is available.]  \n",

       "94  [I think apple gets that AI is the combustion engine of this era.  As we develop more sophisticated processing powers, it will allow us to make better and better systems.  We have the sizes of the devices optimized but soon we will see it able to do more.  That is why it is not artificial intelligence because it is about integrating into the filter of apple's devices and capabilities.  Rabbit is poorly designed and cannot improve itself because it lacks the ability to provide feedback to the AI.  When they design the products and services including apple, there has to be at least 2 options to where it can tailor solutions to it unless there is a certain solution like in maths as the best feedback is that it is wrong.  If there is an idiocracy movie, it is that we all become so reliant on AI that no one checks the answer to a math problem and everyone just takes AI's word for it and the math problem is completely wrong.  That is a problem., I actually appreciate that Apple refuses to call this technology \"A.I.\", because it definitively, unequivocably is *not* \"artificial intelligence\". I'm not saying the technology isn't interesting and potentially useful (if implemented ethically, which currently none of it is), but it's not \"A.I.\" It shows a streak of integrity from Apple that they would not succumb to marketing hype to literally lie to people about the tech.\\n\\nI'm also impressed that they managed to find a marketing spin that allowed them to draw in all the folks who've fallen for the false terminology while still creating a phrase that doesn't, technically, call it \"artificial intelligence\".\\n\\nI genuinely wish Silicon Valley would just drop \"A.I.\" from its spin machine and get another name for this tech, so it stops getting conflated with the actual science of developing true A.I., It is mildly pleasing that Apple seems to know the difference between artificial intelligence and machine \"learning\". However, being clever at marketing it uses its brand name, beginning with 'A' and links it the broad term \"intelligence\".\\nThus, the craze for muddled ideas about what AI is, in strict definitions, can continue and Apple gets to claim a slice of the whole shebang with clever electronics seeming to be new when they are really extensions/evolution of machine \"learning\". \\nThere is no dishonesty, merely more colorful and responsive fog and a significant step forward to the demise of x-86.]  \n",

       "      <td>My take on WWDC's iPad calculator app: It's nothing more than a gimmick WWDC just dropped yesterday and one of the highlight features was the calculator app feature. MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world. Ok, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks: It’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. You can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly. It can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want. You can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers. The features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools? The first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  In this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. Anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire   That calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad. The second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? Finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. You don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. This reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). It’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. Other examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I will never understand these chucklefucks trying to sell VR as a productivity tool at this stage in its development. Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face. ==================================== My requirements for a phone are actually quite simple:  -a camera with acceptable image quality -no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display -stereo front-facing speakers -a headphone jack as backup for when I need it -expandable storage for when I need it -the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS Thus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone. ==================================== Okay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see. ==================================== I honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet. ==================================== I'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Summarized by AskTube WWDC Keynote Highlights 📱 00:02 Apple's WWDC keynote was filled with exciting announcements, including a surprise introduction to AI in the second half. 00:25 The author live-tweeted the event and summarizes all the key announcements and thoughts. Vision OS 2.0 📊 00:47 Vision OS 2.0 brings new features like wrist-turn gestures to see time and battery percentage, and quick access to the control center. 01:05 New Immersive Media Features: Turn old photos into spatial photos using advanced machine learning, and create spatial videos on non-iPhone cameras. iOS Updates 📱 02:29 iOS got a major update with customizable home screens, icon placement, and a new theme engine. 02:54 Customize your home screen with different colors, and change icon and widget colors to match your wallpaper. Other Updates 📊 03:37 Mac mirroring gets a higher resolution, and new tools are available for creating spatial and immersive videos. 04:00 New features include scheduling text messages, text formatting, a game mode that minimizes background activity, and automatic categorization in the new mail app. AirPods and Apple TV Updates 🎧 06:05 AirPods got minor updates, including voice isolation during phone calls, spatial audio during games, and nodding or shaking for responding to prompts. 06:25 Apple TV updates include showing actors' and characters' names on screen and boosting people's voices over the music. iPad OS Updates 📊 06:41 iPad OS allows remote control of someone's iPad with their permission, perfect for family tech support. 07:03 The calculator app on iPad OS is impressive, letting you write equations in handwriting and getting real-time answers. Mac OS Updates 📊 09:40 Mac OS got a new version called Sequoia, featuring automatic window snapping, built-in backgrounds for webcam feeds, and a new password app. Apple Intelligence AI 🤖 10:40 Apple rebranded AI as Apple Intelligence, bringing new generative models and large language models to supported devices. 11:01 Apple Intelligence features include writing tools, a cleanup tool in Photos, and generative emojis. How Apple Handles Complex AI Tasks 💻 15:10 Apple handles most AI tasks on-device, using Apple-built models for faster processing. However, for complex tasks, Apple has two alternative approaches. 15:32 One approach uses a larger server-based model on Apple's Private Cloud compute, ensuring data is not stored or sent to Apple, but may have downsides like slower processing and internet dependence. 15:54 The other approach asks the user for permission to use ChatGPT, allowing access to its capabilities and generating more realistic and varied images. Privacy and Security of AI Features 🔒 16:18 Apple ensures privacy and security by not storing requests, obscuring IP addresses, and preventing OpenAI from forming a profile. All this is done without an account and for free. Insights on Apple's AI Announcements 🤔 17:01 The author believes Apple's AI features are superior, with personalization and existing user info making them more effective. 17:25 The AI announcements overshadow other features, marking a new age for Apple, and the author is excited to explore its capabilities and what it can bring to users. Conclusion and Future Content 📹 18:06 The author will create more videos about Apple's AI features and encourages viewers to subscribe for updates.</td>\n",

       "      <td>My takeaway was that across MacOS, iOS and iPadOS I found very few things that I could tell I would include in my daily use. I already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions.  I could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter! I just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro.  This came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\" I already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup.  Apple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels. Softwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works. So, I'm out, except for Mac.</td>\n",

       "      <td>**Lots** of great updates. There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance: 1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri. 2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap. 3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat. 4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.   5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.) 6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.) I get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.</td>\n",

We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 \"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\". Romans 10:13 states \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\". \\r \\r    Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.</td>\n",

P.d. They said thar A17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really? They always said new processors of apple silicon are the most fastest in the world all the time, the processor of the iphone 14 pro max is slow?

They could’ve done this back in iOS 14 at once, there’s no reason to take 4 years to incorporate all these features. Summarization was already available on Mac, I’ve sent numerous feature requests, asking them to bring it system-wide to iPads and iPhones. This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray. I predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that.  The only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”.  This isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability.  Last time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected.  Furthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac.  - why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing?  Another thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got: - better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago) - Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind.  A few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I want to thank you for always giving us a well thought videos. Others spend time babbling and trying to be funny and you sound like a tech guy giving us tech news. I have a suggestion to take you to a new level. I have been writing Apple for years. I honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. I’ll share them in a moment. By the way I am a software engineer. I am not one who thinks I am so D smart or the smarted person in the room. I love to always learn and ai find I am always learning new things from you. So my idea for you is a real tech news Channel. This will make you something like the Wal Mart of tech news. This idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. I tried to float this to Apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. We have CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iPhone is released. Tech news is happening every day all day. I say join forces with some of the best like yourself, Brian Tong, possibly some from Engadget and create a real Tech News channel. It’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. EVs and Republicans wanting to K EVs, TicTok, Twitter. With social media companies being as influential as they have become. They’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. A real tech news channel will do this. What you and others do is journalism. I want the news to still be fun but I want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a CNN. You will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech CEO’s. It’s a militia billion. Dollar idea I am giving to you. This is something new of its kind and needed. Tech is no longer just mobile. We have stepped into the world of AI and Humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will I pack them. I would love to work with you as a producer or something. I have a huge idea and it will work.</td>\n",

       "1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               My take on WWDC's iPad calculator app: It's nothing more than a gimmick WWDC just dropped yesterday and one of the highlight features was the calculator app feature. MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world. Ok, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks: It’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. You can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly. It can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want. You can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers. The features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools? The first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  In this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. Anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire   That calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad. The second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? Finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. You don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. This reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). It’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. Other examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.  \n",

Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face. ==================================== My requirements for a phone are actually quite simple:  -a camera with acceptable image quality -no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display -stereo front-facing speakers -a headphone jack as backup for when I need it -expandable storage for when I need it -the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS Thus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone. ==================================== Okay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see. ==================================== I honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet. ==================================== I'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.  \n",

How Apple Handles Complex AI Tasks 💻 15:10 Apple handles most AI tasks on-device, using Apple-built models for faster processing. However, for complex tasks, Apple has two alternative approaches. 15:32 One approach uses a larger server-based model on Apple's Private Cloud compute, ensuring data is not stored or sent to Apple, but may have downsides like slower processing and internet dependence. 15:54 The other approach asks the user for permission to use ChatGPT, allowing access to its capabilities and generating more realistic and varied images. Privacy and Security of AI Features 🔒 16:18 Apple ensures privacy and security by not storing requests, obscuring IP addresses, and preventing OpenAI from forming a profile. All this is done without an account and for free.

I already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions.  I could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter! I just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro.  This came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\" I already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup.  Apple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels. Softwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works. So, I'm out, except for Mac.  \n",

There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance: 1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri. 2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap. 3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat. 4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.   5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.) 6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.) I get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.  \n",

We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 \"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\". Romans 10:13 states \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\". \\r \\r    Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.  \n",

                                                           Not only that, for most of the presentation they did say that iphone would have apple intelligence and in the end they said only iphone 15 pro models, is like... 😂 okay apple, not all people can afford a 1100 and 1300 dollars usd smartphones, thanks, steve jobs said that apple is for the humanity and to give them technology to improve people's lifes, apple had vision, tim cook did it until 2018, then everything has go slowly downhill, not all of it of course, but very down, not only that, but jobs said that according to our efforts we decide the price of our products, we try the most to price it correctly, well that was in 2009, and for your knowledge, apple intelligence is only available for 2 iphones (of more than 24 iphones eligible for the ios 18 update *oh is because they don't have 6gb of ram, well darling the Android phone of my Granny costs 200 dollars and has 8gb of ddr4 ram and on screen ai analysis to summarize websites with Gemini for free -well you exchange your data even when they say no but i don't believe any company in terms of 100% privacy so it's meh for me, is logic, that's why USA gov wants to ban TikTok cuz they don't have control over their info and the excuse is that they are \"spies\"-, apple does not use a \"unique physical ram\" to justify their price, like i say.. thefts*) but hey you have good animations :D and \"the ecosystem\" that windows and android are reaching more fast than ever to the point of apple, apple= no moral and respectful for people's money and time (so contrary to Steve's apple), yeah they have good and incredible things like the integration of apple intelligence offline but it doesn't help the fact that whenever they do something great they put it like god's new technology to justify prices in this times when they are not the unique smartphone company they were in 2007-2018, others are in the same level or little lower or little higher than them in terms of technology, i hope that the apple directive is changed but that will not happen because money runs the world and if they are still selling, nothing will change.  P.d. They said thar A17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really? They always said new processors of apple silicon are the most fastest in the world all the time, the processor of the iphone 14 pro max is slow? Gosh they are really inmoral capitalists (i agree with capitalism and liberal economies)  \n",

They could’ve done this back in iOS 14 at once, there’s no reason to take 4 years to incorporate all these features. Summarization was already available on Mac, I’ve sent numerous feature requests, asking them to bring it system-wide to iPads and iPhones. This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray. I predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that.  The only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”.  This isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability.  Last time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected.  Furthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac.  - why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing?  Another thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got: - better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago) - Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind.  A few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.  \n",

Others spend time babbling and trying to be funny and you sound like a tech guy giving us tech news. I have a suggestion to take you to a new level. I have been writing Apple for years. I honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. I’ll share them in a moment. By the way I am a software engineer. I am not one who thinks I am so D smart or the smarted person in the room. I love to always learn and ai find I am always learning new things from you. So my idea for you is a real tech news Channel. This will make you something like the Wal Mart of tech news. This idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. I tried to float this to Apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. We have CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iPhone is released. Tech news is happening every day all day. I say join forces with some of the best like yourself, Brian Tong, possibly some from Engadget and create a real Tech News channel. It’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. EVs and Republicans wanting to K EVs, TicTok, Twitter. With social media companies being as influential as they have become. They’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. A real tech news channel will do this. What you and others do is journalism. I want the news to still be fun but I want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a CNN. You will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech CEO’s. It’s a militia billion. Dollar idea I am giving to you. This is something new of its kind and needed. Tech is no longer just mobile. We have stepped into the world of AI and Humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will I pack them. I would love to work with you as a producer or something. I have a huge idea and it will work.  "

       "      <td>My take on WWDC's iPad calculator app: It's nothing more than a gimmick WWDC just dropped yesterday and one of the highlight features was the calculator app feature. MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world. Ok, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks: It’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. You can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly. It can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want. You can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers. The features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools? The first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  In this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. Anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire   That calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad. The second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? Finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. You don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. This reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). It’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. Other examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I will never understand these chucklefucks trying to sell VR as a productivity tool at this stage in its development. Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face. ==================================== My requirements for a phone are actually quite simple:  -a camera with acceptable image quality -no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display -stereo front-facing speakers -a headphone jack as backup for when I need it -expandable storage for when I need it -the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS Thus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone. ==================================== Okay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see. ==================================== I honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet. ==================================== I'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Summarized by AskTube WWDC Keynote Highlights 📱 00:02 Apple's WWDC keynote was filled with exciting announcements, including a surprise introduction to AI in the second half. 00:25 The author live-tweeted the event and summarizes all the key announcements and thoughts. Vision OS 2.0 📊 00:47 Vision OS 2.0 brings new features like wrist-turn gestures to see time and battery percentage, and quick access to the control center. 01:05 New Immersive Media Features: Turn old photos into spatial photos using advanced machine learning, and create spatial videos on non-iPhone cameras. iOS Updates 📱 02:29 iOS got a major update with customizable home screens, icon placement, and a new theme engine. 02:54 Customize your home screen with different colors, and change icon and widget colors to match your wallpaper. Other Updates 📊 03:37 Mac mirroring gets a higher resolution, and new tools are available for creating spatial and immersive videos. 04:00 New features include scheduling text messages, text formatting, a game mode that minimizes background activity, and automatic categorization in the new mail app. AirPods and Apple TV Updates 🎧 06:05 AirPods got minor updates, including voice isolation during phone calls, spatial audio during games, and nodding or shaking for responding to prompts. 06:25 Apple TV updates include showing actors' and characters' names on screen and boosting people's voices over the music. iPad OS Updates 📊 06:41 iPad OS allows remote control of someone's iPad with their permission, perfect for family tech support. 07:03 The calculator app on iPad OS is impressive, letting you write equations in handwriting and getting real-time answers. Mac OS Updates 📊 09:40 Mac OS got a new version called Sequoia, featuring automatic window snapping, built-in backgrounds for webcam feeds, and a new password app. Apple Intelligence AI 🤖 10:40 Apple rebranded AI as Apple Intelligence, bringing new generative models and large language models to supported devices. 11:01 Apple Intelligence features include writing tools, a cleanup tool in Photos, and generative emojis. How Apple Handles Complex AI Tasks 💻 15:10 Apple handles most AI tasks on-device, using Apple-built models for faster processing. However, for complex tasks, Apple has two alternative approaches. 15:32 One approach uses a larger server-based model on Apple's Private Cloud compute, ensuring data is not stored or sent to Apple, but may have downsides like slower processing and internet dependence. 15:54 The other approach asks the user for permission to use ChatGPT, allowing access to its capabilities and generating more realistic and varied images. Privacy and Security of AI Features 🔒 16:18 Apple ensures privacy and security by not storing requests, obscuring IP addresses, and preventing OpenAI from forming a profile. All this is done without an account and for free. Insights on Apple's AI Announcements 🤔 17:01 The author believes Apple's AI features are superior, with personalization and existing user info making them more effective. 17:25 The AI announcements overshadow other features, marking a new age for Apple, and the author is excited to explore its capabilities and what it can bring to users.

       "      <td>My takeaway was that across MacOS, iOS and iPadOS I found very few things that I could tell I would include in my daily use. I already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions.  I could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter! I just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro.  This came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\" I already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup.  Apple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels. Softwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works. So, I'm out, except for Mac.</td>\n",

       "      <td>**Lots** of great updates. There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance: 1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri. 2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap. 3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat. 4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.   5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.) 6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.) I get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.</td>\n",

We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 \"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\". Romans 10:13 states \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\". \\r \\r    Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.</td>\n",

P.d. They said thar A17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really? They always said new processors of apple silicon are the most fastest in the world all the time, the processor of the iphone 14 pro max is slow?

       "      <td>My first impression is definitely that they’re playing catch-up, in terms of QoL features. They could’ve done this back in iOS 14 at once, there’s no reason to take 4 years to incorporate all these features. Summarization was already available on Mac, I’ve sent numerous feature requests, asking them to bring it system-wide to iPads and iPhones. This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray. I predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that.  The only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”.  This isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability.  Last time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected.  Furthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac.  - why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing?  Another thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got: - better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago) - Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind.  A few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.</td>\n",

I have a suggestion to take you to a new level. I have been writing Apple for years. I honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. I’ll share them in a moment. By the way I am a software engineer. I am not one who thinks I am so D smart or the smarted person in the room. I love to always learn and ai find I am always learning new things from you. So my idea for you is a real tech news Channel. This will make you something like the Wal Mart of tech news. This idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. I tried to float this to Apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. We have CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iPhone is released. Tech news is happening every day all day. I say join forces with some of the best like yourself, Brian Tong, possibly some from Engadget and create a real Tech News channel. It’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. EVs and Republicans wanting to K EVs, TicTok, Twitter. With social media companies being as influential as they have become. They’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. A real tech news channel will do this. What you and others do is journalism. I want the news to still be fun but I want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a CNN. You will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech CEO’s. It’s a militia billion. Dollar idea I am giving to you. This is something new of its kind and needed. Tech is no longer just mobile. We have stepped into the world of AI and Humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will I pack them. I would love to work with you as a producer or something. I have a huge idea and it will work.</td>\n",

       "1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               My take on WWDC's iPad calculator app: It's nothing more than a gimmick WWDC just dropped yesterday and one of the highlight features was the calculator app feature. MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world. Ok, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks: It’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. You can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly. It can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want. You can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers. The features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools? The first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  In this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. Anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire   That calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad. The second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? Finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. You don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. This reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). It’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. Other examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.   \n",

Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face. ==================================== My requirements for a phone are actually quite simple:  -a camera with acceptable image quality -no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display -stereo front-facing speakers -a headphone jack as backup for when I need it -expandable storage for when I need it -the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS Thus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone. ==================================== Okay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see. ==================================== I honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet. ==================================== I'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.   \n",

How Apple Handles Complex AI Tasks 💻 15:10 Apple handles most AI tasks on-device, using Apple-built models for faster processing. However, for complex tasks, Apple has two alternative approaches. 15:32 One approach uses a larger server-based model on Apple's Private Cloud compute, ensuring data is not stored or sent to Apple, but may have downsides like slower processing and internet dependence. 15:54 The other approach asks the user for permission to use ChatGPT, allowing access to its capabilities and generating more realistic and varied images. Privacy and Security of AI Features 🔒 16:18 Apple ensures privacy and security by not storing requests, obscuring IP addresses, and preventing OpenAI from forming a profile. All this is done without an account and for free.

I already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions.  I could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter! I just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro.  This came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\" I already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup.  Apple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels. Softwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works. So, I'm out, except for Mac.   \n",

There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance: 1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri. 2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap. 3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat. 4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.   5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.) 6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.) I get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.   \n",

We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 \"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\". Romans 10:13 states \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\". \\r \\r    Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.   \n",

                                                           Not only that, for most of the presentation they did say that iphone would have apple intelligence and in the end they said only iphone 15 pro models, is like... 😂 okay apple, not all people can afford a 1100 and 1300 dollars usd smartphones, thanks, steve jobs said that apple is for the humanity and to give them technology to improve people's lifes, apple had vision, tim cook did it until 2018, then everything has go slowly downhill, not all of it of course, but very down, not only that, but jobs said that according to our efforts we decide the price of our products, we try the most to price it correctly, well that was in 2009, and for your knowledge, apple intelligence is only available for 2 iphones (of more than 24 iphones eligible for the ios 18 update *oh is because they don't have 6gb of ram, well darling the Android phone of my Granny costs 200 dollars and has 8gb of ddr4 ram and on screen ai analysis to summarize websites with Gemini for free -well you exchange your data even when they say no but i don't believe any company in terms of 100% privacy so it's meh for me, is logic, that's why USA gov wants to ban TikTok cuz they don't have control over their info and the excuse is that they are \"spies\"-, apple does not use a \"unique physical ram\" to justify their price, like i say.. thefts*) but hey you have good animations :D and \"the ecosystem\" that windows and android are reaching more fast than ever to the point of apple, apple= no moral and respectful for people's money and time (so contrary to Steve's apple), yeah they have good and incredible things like the integration of apple intelligence offline but it doesn't help the fact that whenever they do something great they put it like god's new technology to justify prices in this times when they are not the unique smartphone company they were in 2007-2018, others are in the same level or little lower or little higher than them in terms of technology, i hope that the apple directive is changed but that will not happen because money runs the world and if they are still selling, nothing will change.  P.d. They said thar A17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really? They always said new processors of apple silicon are the most fastest in the world all the time, the processor of the iphone 14 pro max is slow? Gosh they are really inmoral capitalists (i agree with capitalism and liberal economies)   \n",

They could’ve done this back in iOS 14 at once, there’s no reason to take 4 years to incorporate all these features. Summarization was already available on Mac, I’ve sent numerous feature requests, asking them to bring it system-wide to iPads and iPhones. This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray. I predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that.  The only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”.  This isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability.  Last time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected.  Furthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac.  - why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing?  Another thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got: - better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago) - Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind.  A few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.   \n",

Others spend time babbling and trying to be funny and you sound like a tech guy giving us tech news. I have a suggestion to take you to a new level. I have been writing Apple for years. I honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. I’ll share them in a moment. By the way I am a software engineer. I am not one who thinks I am so D smart or the smarted person in the room. I love to always learn and ai find I am always learning new things from you. So my idea for you is a real tech news Channel. This will make you something like the Wal Mart of tech news. This idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. I tried to float this to Apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. We have CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iPhone is released. Tech news is happening every day all day. I say join forces with some of the best like yourself, Brian Tong, possibly some from Engadget and create a real Tech News channel. It’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. EVs and Republicans wanting to K EVs, TicTok, Twitter. With social media companies being as influential as they have become. They’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. A real tech news channel will do this. What you and others do is journalism. I want the news to still be fun but I want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a CNN. You will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech CEO’s. It’s a militia billion. Dollar idea I am giving to you. This is something new of its kind and needed. Tech is no longer just mobile. We have stepped into the world of AI and Humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will I pack them. I would love to work with you as a producer or something. I have a huge idea and it will work.   \n",

       "\"My take on WWDC's iPad calculator app: It's nothing more than a gimmick WWDC just dropped yesterday and one of the highlight features was the calculator app feature. MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world. Ok, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks: It’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. You can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly. It can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want. You can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers. The features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools? The first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  In this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. Anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire   That calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad. The second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? Finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. You don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. This reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). It’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. Other examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.\""

I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness.

You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools? The first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  In this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. Anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire   That calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad. The second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? Finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. You don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. This reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). It’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. Other examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.</td>\n",
       "      <td>WWDC's iPad calculator app is a gimmick that will likely gather dust. Even MKBHD, a renowned tech reviewer, called it the only \"incredible feature\" from WWDC, but I believe it's overhyped. The app can provide answers as you write down a math question, adjust variables, and add graphs, but these features are only useful for primary school-level math. Beyond 4th grade, students need to manipulate equations and show their work, making the app unnecessary. A physical calculator is faster, easier, and more representative of exam conditions. The TI-Nspire calculator, specifically, blows the iPad's math notes feature out of the water in terms of functionality and features.\\n\\nAdditionally, alternatives like Geogebra and Desmos offer more features for free, making the iPad's math notes feature redundant. The novelty of the app is appealing, but it doesn't hold up in real-world context. The hype surrounding the app is similar to the hype surrounding humanoid robots, which are impressive in theory but lack practical applications. I believe we should focus on the usefulness of a product rather than its engineering complexity.</td>\n",

P.d. They said thar A17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really? They always said new processors of apple silicon are the most fastest in the world all the time, the processor of the iphone 14 pro max is slow?

Steve Jobs believed that Apple should make technology accessible to humanity, but it seems like Tim Cook has taken a different approach. Jobs also emphasized that Apple prices its products reasonably, but that's not the case with the new iPhones. Most people can't afford the $1100-$1300 price tag, and it's unfair to limit Apple Intelligence to only a select few models. It's hypocritical of Apple to claim they're for humanity while prioritizing profit over people's wallets.\\n\\nApple's A17 Pro chipset is supposed to be the only capable of running Apple Intelligence, which raises questions about the performance of previous processors. The iPhone 14 Pro Max has a slower processor? It seems like Apple is prioritizing profit over innovation. It's clear that Apple is in it for the money and doesn't care about its customers. Apple's emphasis on \"the ecosystem\" is just an excuse to keep people locked into their products.</td>\n",

I have a suggestion to take you to a new level. I have been writing Apple for years. I honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. I’ll share them in a moment. By the way I am a software engineer. I am not one who thinks I am so D smart or the smarted person in the room. I love to always learn and ai find I am always learning new things from you. So my idea for you is a real tech news Channel. This will make you something like the Wal Mart of tech news. This idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. I tried to float this to Apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. We have CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iPhone is released. Tech news is happening every day all day. I say join forces with some of the best like yourself, Brian Tong, possibly some from Engadget and create a real Tech News channel. It’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. EVs and Republicans wanting to K EVs, TicTok, Twitter. With social media companies being as influential as they have become. They’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. A real tech news channel will do this. What you and others do is journalism. I want the news to still be fun but I want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a CNN. You will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech CEO’s. It’s a militia billion. Dollar idea I am giving to you. This is something new of its kind and needed. Tech is no longer just mobile. We have stepped into the world of AI and Humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will I pack them. I would love to work with you as a producer or something. I have a huge idea and it will work.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I will never understand these chucklefucks trying to sell VR as a productivity tool at this stage in its development. Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face. ==================================== My requirements for a phone are actually quite simple:  -a camera with acceptable image quality -no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display -stereo front-facing speakers -a headphone jack as backup for when I need it -expandable storage for when I need it -the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS Thus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone. ==================================== Okay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see. ==================================== I honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet. ==================================== I'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.</td>\n",

I've yet to find a device that meets all these criteria, and the iPhone doesn't fit the bill.\\n\\nI recently used iPad OS 18's new calculator app, which is impressive use of OCR and AI. However, I'd rather see AI used to optimize camera settings than just photo editing.

They could’ve done this back in iOS 14 at once, there’s no reason to take 4 years to incorporate all these features. Summarization was already available on Mac, I’ve sent numerous feature requests, asking them to bring it system-wide to iPads and iPhones. This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray. I predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that.  The only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”.  This isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability.  Last time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected.  Furthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac.  - why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing?  Another thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got: - better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago) - Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind.

I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri. 2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap. 3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat. 4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.   5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.) 6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.) I get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.</td>\n",
       "      <td>I'm excited about the latest updates, but there are a few things that didn't sit well with me. I'm not a fan of the generative features, which feel like they're trying to replace Siri's functionality. I prefer more essential Siri features. I'm also not a fan of the color-tinted icons, which remind me of cheap icon packs from the Play Store.\\n\\nThe new Passwords app seems useful for many users, but I already use Bitwarden, so I hope Apple doesn't push their solution on me. I'm also surprised by how prominently ChatGPT is featured, which feels un-Apple-like. I appreciate the new window snapping feature, but I'm not a fan of Stage Manager.\\n\\nThe Settings app has become overwhelming, even with the new AI-powered navigation feature. As a software engineer and consumer, I worry about feature bloat, but I'm still excited to try out the new release.</td>\n",

       "      <td>My takeaway was that across MacOS, iOS and iPadOS I found very few things that I could tell I would include in my daily use. I already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions.  I could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter! I just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro.  This came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\" I already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup.  Apple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels. Softwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works. So, I'm out, except for Mac.</td>\n",
       "      <td>I was unimpressed with the new features announced for MacOS, iOS, and iPadOS. I already use 1Password and BetterTouchTool's snap functions, so Apple's new features won't add value to my daily use. I did find Apple's neglect of virtual desktop handling in MacOS disappointing. I recently traded in my iPad Pro for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+, which offers better value and similar specs. I switched to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4 phone, which provides a unique folding design that I prefer. Apple's announcement that my iPad Pro wouldn't receive iOS 18 was no surprise. The features showcased didn't excite me, as I've already moved away from iOS. I'm not a fan of large phones, but the Fold 4's compact design when folded makes it suitable for me. While Apple makes great hardware, they offer few incentives for users to upgrade. Without engaging software features, I'm unlikely to upgrade my phone or tablet. Samsung's OneUI software allows me to customize its features to my liking, making me feel like I can make it mine. I'm no longer an Apple consumer, except for my Mac, which I will continue to use.</td>\n",

We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 \"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\". Romans 10:13 states \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\". \\r \\r    Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.   \n",

MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world. Ok, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks: It’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. You can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly. It can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want. You can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers. The features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools? The first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  In this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. Anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire   That calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad. The second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? Finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. You don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. This reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). It’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. Other examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.   \n",

                                                           Not only that, for most of the presentation they did say that iphone would have apple intelligence and in the end they said only iphone 15 pro models, is like... 😂 okay apple, not all people can afford a 1100 and 1300 dollars usd smartphones, thanks, steve jobs said that apple is for the humanity and to give them technology to improve people's lifes, apple had vision, tim cook did it until 2018, then everything has go slowly downhill, not all of it of course, but very down, not only that, but jobs said that according to our efforts we decide the price of our products, we try the most to price it correctly, well that was in 2009, and for your knowledge, apple intelligence is only available for 2 iphones (of more than 24 iphones eligible for the ios 18 update *oh is because they don't have 6gb of ram, well darling the Android phone of my Granny costs 200 dollars and has 8gb of ddr4 ram and on screen ai analysis to summarize websites with Gemini for free -well you exchange your data even when they say no but i don't believe any company in terms of 100% privacy so it's meh for me, is logic, that's why USA gov wants to ban TikTok cuz they don't have control over their info and the excuse is that they are \"spies\"-, apple does not use a \"unique physical ram\" to justify their price, like i say.. thefts*) but hey you have good animations :D and \"the ecosystem\" that windows and android are reaching more fast than ever to the point of apple, apple= no moral and respectful for people's money and time (so contrary to Steve's apple), yeah they have good and incredible things like the integration of apple intelligence offline but it doesn't help the fact that whenever they do something great they put it like god's new technology to justify prices in this times when they are not the unique smartphone company they were in 2007-2018, others are in the same level or little lower or little higher than them in terms of technology, i hope that the apple directive is changed but that will not happen because money runs the world and if they are still selling, nothing will change.  P.d. They said thar A17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really? They always said new processors of apple silicon are the most fastest in the world all the time, the processor of the iphone 14 pro max is slow? Gosh they are really inmoral capitalists (i agree with capitalism and liberal economies)   \n",

Others spend time babbling and trying to be funny and you sound like a tech guy giving us tech news. I have a suggestion to take you to a new level. I have been writing Apple for years. I honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. I’ll share them in a moment. By the way I am a software engineer. I am not one who thinks I am so D smart or the smarted person in the room. I love to always learn and ai find I am always learning new things from you. So my idea for you is a real tech news Channel. This will make you something like the Wal Mart of tech news. This idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. I tried to float this to Apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. We have CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iPhone is released. Tech news is happening every day all day. I say join forces with some of the best like yourself, Brian Tong, possibly some from Engadget and create a real Tech News channel. It’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. EVs and Republicans wanting to K EVs, TicTok, Twitter. With social media companies being as influential as they have become. They’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. A real tech news channel will do this. What you and others do is journalism. I want the news to still be fun but I want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a CNN. You will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech CEO’s. It’s a militia billion. Dollar idea I am giving to you. This is something new of its kind and needed. Tech is no longer just mobile. We have stepped into the world of AI and Humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will I pack them. I would love to work with you as a producer or something. I have a huge idea and it will work.   \n",

Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face. ==================================== My requirements for a phone are actually quite simple:  -a camera with acceptable image quality -no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display -stereo front-facing speakers -a headphone jack as backup for when I need it -expandable storage for when I need it -the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS Thus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone. ==================================== Okay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see. ==================================== I honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet. ==================================== I'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.   \n",

They could’ve done this back in iOS 14 at once, there’s no reason to take 4 years to incorporate all these features. Summarization was already available on Mac, I’ve sent numerous feature requests, asking them to bring it system-wide to iPads and iPhones. This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray. I predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that.  The only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”.  This isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability.  Last time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected.  Furthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac.  - why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing?  Another thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got: - better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago) - Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind.  A few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.   \n",

There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance: 1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri. 2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap. 3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat. 4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.   5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.) 6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.) I get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.   \n",

I already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions.  I could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter! I just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro.  This came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\" I already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup.  Apple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels. Softwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works. So, I'm out, except for Mac.   \n",

But God sent Jesus to Earth as a perfect sacrifice to take on our sins and offer us salvation. Jesus shed his blood on the cross to atone for our sins and rose from the dead on the third day to show life after death. To be saved, we need to believe that Jesus died for our sins and rose from the grave. We also need to ask Jesus to save us and give us eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free gift from God, but pride can keep us from accepting it. Satan doesn't want us to get saved and will try to resist us, but we shouldn't let him win. Hell is not a pleasant place, it's eternal torture with no relief. I want to share this message to help people understand the importance of salvation. There are many distractions in life that can keep us from thinking about our eternal destiny. So, I urge you to ask Jesus into your heart to save you from your sins and give you a place in Heaven.  \n",

Even MKBHD, a renowned tech reviewer, called it the only \"incredible feature\" from WWDC, but I believe it's overhyped. The app can provide answers as you write down a math question, adjust variables, and add graphs, but these features are only useful for primary school-level math. Beyond 4th grade, students need to manipulate equations and show their work, making the app unnecessary. A physical calculator is faster, easier, and more representative of exam conditions. The TI-Nspire calculator, specifically, blows the iPad's math notes feature out of the water in terms of functionality and features.\\n\\nAdditionally, alternatives like Geogebra and Desmos offer more features for free, making the iPad's math notes feature redundant. The novelty of the app is appealing, but it doesn't hold up in real-world context. The hype surrounding the app is similar to the hype surrounding humanoid robots, which are impressive in theory but lack practical applications. I believe we should focus on the usefulness of a product rather than its engineering complexity.  \n",

Steve Jobs believed that Apple should make technology accessible to humanity, but it seems like Tim Cook has taken a different approach. Jobs also emphasized that Apple prices its products reasonably, but that's not the case with the new iPhones. Most people can't afford the $1100-$1300 price tag, and it's unfair to limit Apple Intelligence to only a select few models. It's hypocritical of Apple to claim they're for humanity while prioritizing profit over people's wallets.\\n\\nApple's A17 Pro chipset is supposed to be the only capable of running Apple Intelligence, which raises questions about the performance of previous processors. The iPhone 14 Pro Max has a slower processor? It seems like Apple is prioritizing profit over innovation. It's clear that Apple is in it for the money and doesn't care about its customers. Apple's emphasis on \"the ecosystem\" is just an excuse to keep people locked into their products.  \n",
       "3  Apple's WWDC keynote revealed exciting announcements, including the introduction of AI in the second half of the event. The Vision OS 2.0 brought new features like wrist-turn gestures and quick access to the control center. iOS updated with customizable home screens, icon placement, and a new theme engine. Other updates included scheduling text messages, automatic categorization in the new mail app, and a game mode that minimizes background activity.\\n\\nAirPods got minor updates, including voice isolation and spatial audio. Apple TV updates included showing actor names on screen and boosting voice volumes. iPad OS allowed remote control of another person's iPad with permission. The calculator app on iPad OS let you write equations in handwriting and get real-time answers.\\n\\nMac OS got a new version called Sequoia, featuring automatic window snapping and built-in backgrounds for webcam feeds. Apple rebranded AI as Apple Intelligence, bringing new generative models and language models to supported devices. Apple Intelligence features included writing tools, a cleanup tool in Photos, and generative emojis.\\n\\nApple handles most AI tasks on-device, but for complex tasks, it uses a larger server-based model or allows access to ChatGPT with user permission. Apple ensures privacy and security by not storing requests and obscuring IP addresses. The author believes Apple's AI features are superior and exciting to explore.  \n",
       "4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I want to thank you for your well-researched and informative videos, unlike many others who try to be funny or entertaining. As a software engineer, I've been suggesting ideas to Apple for years, and I believe they've used some of them. I think you could take your channel to the next level by creating a real tech news channel. This would make you like the Walmart of tech news and potentially put some tech influencers out of business.\\n\\nI suggested this idea to Apple, but they didn't seem interested. There's a lack of dedicated tech news coverage beyond occasional updates when new products are released. A 24/7 tech news channel could fill this gap and provide in-depth interviews with tech CEOs. The channel could also cover the intersection of tech and politics.\\n\\nI propose hiring anchors and running a channel similar to CNN, but with a focus on tech. I believe this concept has the potential to be a billion-dollar idea. I'd be happy to work with you as a producer or contributor to help bring this project to life. I'm confident that it would be a game-changer for the tech industry and informed viewers.  \n",
       "5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I think it's premature to market VR as a productivity tool, considering the bulky size and weight of current headsets. I'd wait until they develop a more compact design before considering it for work. My phone requirements are simple: good camera, no notch, stereo speakers, expandable storage, and a headphone jack. I've yet to find a device that meets all these criteria, and the iPhone doesn't fit the bill.\\n\\nI recently used iPad OS 18's new calculator app, which is impressive use of OCR and AI. However, I'd rather see AI used to optimize camera settings than just photo editing. I'd like to see faster sensors and AI-powered multi-shot merging, allowing for greater control over camera settings.\\n\\nI'm disappointed that Apple didn't announce updates to their high-end Mac products, including the M3 or M4 Ultra chip and the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators relying on Macs should be eager to know when these upgrades will be available.  \n",
       "6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               My first impression is that Apple is playing catch-up with Quality of Life features. I had requested some of these features years ago, and they're only being added now. Apple could have incorporated them into iOS 14, but instead, they're rolling them out over four years. Features like summarization, which have been available on Mac, are now being added to iPads and iPhones. Other companies like Google and Amazon have already implemented these features.\\n\\nI predict that iPads will become more powerful and the Files app will be reformed in the next five years. The original features in the latest update were mostly image and emoji generation, which reminded me of DALL-E and Midjourney mock-ups. I'm not criticizing Apple for adopting these features, but I miss the days when we got feature-packed updates for Mac OS X.\\n\\nInstead, we're getting incremental features that often introduce bugs. The last time Apple focused on improving reliability was in 2018 with iOS 12. Since then, iPads have become more buggy and feel neglected. The features added in this update could be done on an iPhone or Mac, making me wonder why I would pay $1000 for an iPad Pro when a $300 iPad does the same thing.  \n",

VisionOS 2 has 2k native apps, 1.5m compatible apps, and features like 2D to 3D photo conversion and spatial lens support. iOS 18 has a rearranged home screen, dark mode, and a new Control Center with multiple pages and full-screen widgets. Mail has been redesigned with AI-powered email categorization and photo filters, and there's a new Journal app. Apple's also launching AirPods with nod or shake response to Siri and voice isolation.\\n\\ntvOS has topographic maps, tap-to-cash, and better event tickets, while watchOS 11 has training mode, new fitness tracking features, and a redesigned Cycle Tracking app. iPadOS has redesigned apps, Shareplay, and a new Calculator app. macOS Sequoia has Continuity, iPhone mirroring, and a revamped Passwords app.\\n\\nApple also announced its AI capabilities, including \"Apple Intelligence\" for writing, proofreading, and summarization, as well as an Image Playground and Image Wand for creating images. Siri has better language understanding and can perform tasks like taking photos and searching for information. Finally, Apple's chatbot, ChatGPT 4o, can answer general knowledge questions and generate complex images.  \n",

I'm not a fan of the generative features, which feel like they're trying to replace Siri's functionality. I prefer more essential Siri features. I'm also not a fan of the color-tinted icons, which remind me of cheap icon packs from the Play Store.\\n\\nThe new Passwords app seems useful for many users, but I already use Bitwarden, so I hope Apple doesn't push their solution on me. I'm also surprised by how prominently ChatGPT is featured, which feels un-Apple-like. I appreciate the new window snapping feature, but I'm not a fan of Stage Manager.\\n\\nThe Settings app has become overwhelming, even with the new AI-powered navigation feature. As a software engineer and consumer, I worry about feature bloat, but I'm still excited to try out the new release.  \n",
       "9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I was unimpressed with the new features announced for MacOS, iOS, and iPadOS. I already use 1Password and BetterTouchTool's snap functions, so Apple's new features won't add value to my daily use. I did find Apple's neglect of virtual desktop handling in MacOS disappointing. I recently traded in my iPad Pro for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+, which offers better value and similar specs. I switched to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4 phone, which provides a unique folding design that I prefer. Apple's announcement that my iPad Pro wouldn't receive iOS 18 was no surprise. The features showcased didn't excite me, as I've already moved away from iOS. I'm not a fan of large phones, but the Fold 4's compact design when folded makes it suitable for me. While Apple makes great hardware, they offer few incentives for users to upgrade. Without engaging software features, I'm unlikely to upgrade my phone or tablet. Samsung's OneUI software allows me to customize its features to my liking, making me feel like I can make it mine. I'm no longer an Apple consumer, except for my Mac, which I will continue to use.  "

We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 \"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\".

Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.</td>\n",

       "      <td>My take on WWDC's iPad calculator app: It's nothing more than a gimmick\\n\\nWWDC just dropped yesterday and one of the highlight features was the calculator app feature. MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world.\\n\\nOk, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks:\\n\\nIt’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question.\\n\\nYou can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly.\\n\\nIt can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want.\\n\\nYou can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers.\\n\\nThe features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools?\\n\\nThe first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic. \\n\\nIn this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer.\\n\\nAnything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire \\n\\n\\nThat calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad.\\n\\nThe second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons?\\n\\nFinally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all.\\n\\nYou don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype.\\n\\nThis reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing).\\n\\nIt’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives.\\n\\nOther examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.</td>\n",

Even MKBHD, a renowned tech reviewer, called it the only \"incredible feature\" from WWDC, but I believe it's overhyped. The app can provide answers as you write down a math question, adjust variables, and add graphs, but these features are only useful for primary school-level math. Beyond 4th grade, students need to manipulate equations and show their work, making the app unnecessary. A physical calculator is faster, easier, and more representative of exam conditions. The TI-Nspire calculator, specifically, blows the iPad's math notes feature out of the water in terms of functionality and features. Additionally, alternatives like Geogebra and Desmos offer more features for free, making the iPad's math notes feature redundant. The novelty of the app is appealing, but it doesn't hold up in real-world context. The hype surrounding the app is similar to the hype surrounding humanoid robots, which are impressive in theory but lack practical applications.

They said thar A17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really? They always said new processors of apple silicon are the most fastest in the world all the time, the processor of the iphone 14 pro max is slow?

       "      <td>Apple's recent presentation claimed that only iPhone 15 Pro models have Apple Intelligence, which is disappointing considering the high price tag. Steve Jobs believed that Apple should make technology accessible to humanity, but it seems like Tim Cook has taken a different approach. Jobs also emphasized that Apple prices its products reasonably, but that's not the case with the new iPhones. Most people can't afford the $1100-$1300 price tag, and it's unfair to limit Apple Intelligence to only a select few models. It's hypocritical of Apple to claim they're for humanity while prioritizing profit over people's wallets. Apple's A17 Pro chipset is supposed to be the only capable of running Apple Intelligence, which raises questions about the performance of previous processors. The iPhone 14 Pro Max has a slower processor? It seems like Apple is prioritizing profit over innovation. It's clear that Apple is in it for the money and doesn't care about its customers. Apple's emphasis on \"the ecosystem\" is just an excuse to keep people locked into their products.</td>\n",

I have a suggestion to take you to a new level. I have been writing Apple for years. I honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. I’ll share them in a moment. By the way I am a software engineer. I am not one who thinks I am so D smart or the smarted person in the room. I love to always learn and ai find I am always learning new things from you. So my idea for you is a real tech news Channel. This will make you something like the Wal Mart of tech news. This idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. I tried to float this to Apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. We have CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iPhone is released. Tech news is happening every day all day. I say join forces with some of the best like yourself, Brian Tong, possibly some from Engadget and create a real Tech News channel. It’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. EVs and Republicans wanting to K EVs, TicTok, Twitter. With social media companies being as influential as they have become. They’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. A real tech news channel will do this. What you and others do is journalism. I want the news to still be fun but I want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a CNN. You will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech CEO’s. It’s a militia billion. Dollar idea I am giving to you. This is something new of its kind and needed. Tech is no longer just mobile. We have stepped into the world of AI and Humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will I pack them. I would love to work with you as a producer or something. I have a huge idea and it will work.</td>\n",

This would make you like the Walmart of tech news and potentially put some tech influencers out of business. I suggested this idea to Apple, but they didn't seem interested. There's a lack of dedicated tech news coverage beyond occasional updates when new products are released. A 24/7 tech news channel could fill this gap and provide in-depth interviews with tech CEOs. The channel could also cover the intersection of tech and politics. I propose hiring anchors and running a channel similar to CNN, but with a focus on tech. I believe this concept has the potential to be a billion-dollar idea. I'd be happy to work with you as a producer or contributor to help bring this project to life. I'm confident that it would be a game-changer for the tech industry and informed viewers.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I will never understand these chucklefucks trying to sell VR as a productivity tool at this stage in its development. Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face.\\n====================================\\nMy requirements for a phone are actually quite simple: \\n-a camera with acceptable image quality\\n-no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display\\n-stereo front-facing speakers\\n-a headphone jack as backup for when I need it\\n-expandable storage for when I need it\\n-the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS\\n\\nThus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone.\\n====================================\\nOkay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see.\\n====================================\\nI honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet.\\n====================================\\nI'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I think it's premature to market VR as a productivity tool, considering the bulky size and weight of current headsets. I'd wait until they develop a more compact design before considering it for work. My phone requirements are simple: good camera, no notch, stereo speakers, expandable storage, and a headphone jack. I've yet to find a device that meets all these criteria, and the iPhone doesn't fit the bill. I recently used iPad OS 18's new calculator app, which is impressive use of OCR and AI. However, I'd rather see AI used to optimize camera settings than just photo editing. I'd like to see faster sensors and AI-powered multi-shot merging, allowing for greater control over camera settings. I'm disappointed that Apple didn't announce updates to their high-end Mac products, including the M3 or M4 Ultra chip and the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators relying on Macs should be eager to know when these upgrades will be available.</td>\n",

This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray.\\n\\nI predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that. \\n\\nThe only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”. \\n\\nThis isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability. \\nLast time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected. \\nFurthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac. \\n- why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing? \\nAnother thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got:\\n- better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago)\\n- Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind. \\n\\nA few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.</td>\n",

       "      <td>**Lots** of great updates. There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance:\\n\\n1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri.\\n2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap.\\n3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat.\\n4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.  \\n5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.)\\n6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.)\\n\\nI get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.</td>\n",

I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions. \\n\\nI could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter!\\n\\nI just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro. \\n\\nThis came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\"\\n\\nI already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup. \\n\\nApple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels.\\n\\nSoftwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works.\\n\\nSo, I'm out, except for Mac.</td>\n",

I recently traded in my iPad Pro for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+, which offers better value and similar specs. I switched to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4 phone, which provides a unique folding design that I prefer. Apple's announcement that my iPad Pro wouldn't receive iOS 18 was no surprise.

I use Bitwarden. If they just plug into the existing extensibility model, and this new app is treated the same as a third-party option, then I’m happy.   \n",

We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 \"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\". Romans 10:13 states \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\". \\r\\n\\r\\n   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.   \n",

MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world.\\n\\nOk, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks:\\n\\nIt’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question.\\n\\nYou can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly.\\n\\nIt can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want.\\n\\nYou can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers.\\n\\nThe features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools?\\n\\nThe first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic. \\n\\nIn this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer.\\n\\nAnything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire \\n\\n\\nThat calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad.\\n\\nThe second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons?\\n\\nFinally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all.\\n\\nYou don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype.\\n\\nThis reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing).\\n\\nIt’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives.\\n\\nOther examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.   \n",

intelligence and in the end they said only iphone 15 pro models, is like... 😂 okay apple, not all people can afford a 1100 and 1300 dollars usd smartphones, thanks, steve jobs said that apple is for the humanity and to give them technology to improve people's lifes, apple had vision, tim cook did it until 2018, then everything has go slowly downhill, not all of it of course, but very down, not only that, but jobs said that according to our efforts we decide the price of our products, we try the most to price it correctly, well that was in 2009, and for your knowledge, apple intelligence is only available for 2 iphones (of more than 24 iphones eligible for the ios 18 update *oh is because they don't have 6gb of ram, well darling the Android phone of my Granny costs 200 dollars and has 8gb of ddr4 ram and on screen ai analysis to summarize websites with Gemini for free -well you exchange your data even when they say no but i don't believe any company in terms of 100% privacy so it's meh for me, is logic, that's why USA gov wants to ban TikTok cuz they don't have control over their info and the excuse is that they are \"spies\"-, apple does not use a \"unique physical ram\" to justify their price, like i say.. thefts*) but hey you have good animations :D and \"the ecosystem\" that windows and android are reaching more fast than ever to the point of apple, apple= no moral and respectful for people's money and time (so contrary to Steve's apple), yeah they have good and incredible things like the integration of apple intelligence offline but it doesn't help the fact that whenever they do something great they put it like god's new technology to justify prices in this times when they are not the unique smartphone company they were in 2007-2018, others are in the same level or little lower or little higher than them in terms of technology, i hope that the apple directive is changed but that will not happen because money runs the world and if they are still selling, nothing will change. \\n\\nP.d. They said thar A17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really? They always said new processors of apple silicon are the most fastest in the world all the time, the processor of the iphone 14 pro max is slow? Gosh they are really inmoral capitalists (i agree with capitalism and liberal economies)   \n",

Others spend time babbling and trying to be funny and you sound like a tech guy giving us tech news. I have a suggestion to take you to a new level. I have been writing Apple for years. I honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. I’ll share them in a moment. By the way I am a software engineer. I am not one who thinks I am so D smart or the smarted person in the room. I love to always learn and ai find I am always learning new things from you. So my idea for you is a real tech news Channel. This will make you something like the Wal Mart of tech news. This idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. I tried to float this to Apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. We have CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iPhone is released. Tech news is happening every day all day. I say join forces with some of the best like yourself, Brian Tong, possibly some from Engadget and create a real Tech News channel. It’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. EVs and Republicans wanting to K EVs, TicTok, Twitter. With social media companies being as influential as they have become. They’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. A real tech news channel will do this. What you and others do is journalism. I want the news to still be fun but I want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a CNN. You will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech CEO’s. It’s a militia billion. Dollar idea I am giving to you. This is something new of its kind and needed. Tech is no longer just mobile. We have stepped into the world of AI and Humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will I pack them. I would love to work with you as a producer or something. I have a huge idea and it will work.   \n",

Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face.\\n====================================\\nMy requirements for a phone are actually quite simple: \\n-a camera with acceptable image quality\\n-no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display\\n-stereo front-facing speakers\\n-a headphone jack as backup for when I need it\\n-expandable storage for when I need it\\n-the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS\\n\\nThus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone.\\n====================================\\nOkay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see.\\n====================================\\nI honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet.\\n====================================\\nI'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.   \n",

This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray.\\n\\nI predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that. \\n\\nThe only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”. \\n\\nThis isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability. \\nLast time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected. \\nFurthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac. \\n- why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing? \\nAnother thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got:\\n- better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago)\\n- Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind. \\n\\nA few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.   \n",

There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance:\\n\\n1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri.\\n2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap.\\n3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat.\\n4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.  \\n5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.)\\n6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.)\\n\\nI get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.   \n",

I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions. \\n\\nI could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter!\\n\\nI just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro. \\n\\nThis came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\"\\n\\nI already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup. \\n\\nApple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels.\\n\\nSoftwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works.\\n\\nSo, I'm out, except for Mac.   \n",

But God sent Jesus to Earth as a perfect sacrifice to take on our sins and offer us salvation. Jesus shed his blood on the cross to atone for our sins and rose from the dead on the third day to show life after death. To be saved, we need to believe that Jesus died for our sins and rose from the grave. We also need to ask Jesus to save us and give us eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free gift from God, but pride can keep us from accepting it. Satan doesn't want us to get saved and will try to resist us, but we shouldn't let him win. Hell is not a pleasant place, it's eternal torture with no relief. I want to share this message to help people understand the importance of salvation. There are many distractions in life that can keep us from thinking about our eternal destiny. So, I urge you to ask Jesus into your heart to save you from your sins and give you a place in Heaven.  \n",

Even MKBHD, a renowned tech reviewer, called it the only \"incredible feature\" from WWDC, but I believe it's overhyped. The app can provide answers as you write down a math question, adjust variables, and add graphs, but these features are only useful for primary school-level math. Beyond 4th grade, students need to manipulate equations and show their work, making the app unnecessary. A physical calculator is faster, easier, and more representative of exam conditions. The TI-Nspire calculator, specifically, blows the iPad's math notes feature out of the water in terms of functionality and features. Additionally, alternatives like Geogebra and Desmos offer more features for free, making the iPad's math notes feature redundant. The novelty of the app is appealing, but it doesn't hold up in real-world context. The hype surrounding the app is similar to the hype surrounding humanoid robots, which are impressive in theory but lack practical applications. I believe we should focus on the usefulness of a product rather than its engineering complexity.  \n",

Steve Jobs believed that Apple should make technology accessible to humanity, but it seems like Tim Cook has taken a different approach. Jobs also emphasized that Apple prices its products reasonably, but that's not the case with the new iPhones. Most people can't afford the $1100-$1300 price tag, and it's unfair to limit Apple Intelligence to only a select few models. It's hypocritical of Apple to claim they're for humanity while prioritizing profit over people's wallets. Apple's A17 Pro chipset is supposed to be the only capable of running Apple Intelligence, which raises questions about the performance of previous processors. The iPhone 14 Pro Max has a slower processor? It seems like Apple is prioritizing profit over innovation. It's clear that Apple is in it for the money and doesn't care about its customers. Apple's emphasis on \"the ecosystem\" is just an excuse to keep people locked into their products.  \n",
       "8   Apple's WWDC keynote revealed exciting announcements, including the introduction of AI in the second half of the event. The Vision OS 2.0 brought new features like wrist-turn gestures and quick access to the control center. iOS updated with customizable home screens, icon placement, and a new theme engine. Other updates included scheduling text messages, automatic categorization in the new mail app, and a game mode that minimizes background activity. AirPods got minor updates, including voice isolation and spatial audio. Apple TV updates included showing actor names on screen and boosting voice volumes. iPad OS allowed remote control of another person's iPad with permission. The calculator app on iPad OS let you write equations in handwriting and get real-time answers. Mac OS got a new version called Sequoia, featuring automatic window snapping and built-in backgrounds for webcam feeds. Apple rebranded AI as Apple Intelligence, bringing new generative models and language models to supported devices. Apple Intelligence features included writing tools, a cleanup tool in Photos, and generative emojis. Apple handles most AI tasks on-device, but for complex tasks, it uses a larger server-based model or allows access to ChatGPT with user permission. Apple ensures privacy and security by not storing requests and obscuring IP addresses. The author believes Apple's AI features are superior and exciting to explore.  \n",

As a software engineer, I've been suggesting ideas to Apple for years, and I believe they've used some of them. I think you could take your channel to the next level by creating a real tech news channel. This would make you like the Walmart of tech news and potentially put some tech influencers out of business. I suggested this idea to Apple, but they didn't seem interested. There's a lack of dedicated tech news coverage beyond occasional updates when new products are released. A 24/7 tech news channel could fill this gap and provide in-depth interviews with tech CEOs. The channel could also cover the intersection of tech and politics. I propose hiring anchors and running a channel similar to CNN, but with a focus on tech. I believe this concept has the potential to be a billion-dollar idea. I'd be happy to work with you as a producer or contributor to help bring this project to life. I'm confident that it would be a game-changer for the tech industry and informed viewers.  \n",

I'd wait until they develop a more compact design before considering it for work. My phone requirements are simple: good camera, no notch, stereo speakers, expandable storage, and a headphone jack. I've yet to find a device that meets all these criteria, and the iPhone doesn't fit the bill. I recently used iPad OS 18's new calculator app, which is impressive use of OCR and AI. However, I'd rather see AI used to optimize camera settings than just photo editing. I'd like to see faster sensors and AI-powered multi-shot merging, allowing for greater control over camera settings. I'm disappointed that Apple didn't announce updates to their high-end Mac products, including the M3 or M4 Ultra chip and the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators relying on Macs should be eager to know when these upgrades will be available.  \n",

I had requested some of these features years ago, and they're only being added now. Apple could have incorporated them into iOS 14, but instead, they're rolling them out over four years. Features like summarization, which have been available on Mac, are now being added to iPads and iPhones. Other companies like Google and Amazon have already implemented these features. I predict that iPads will become more powerful and the Files app will be reformed in the next five years. The original features in the latest update were mostly image and emoji generation, which reminded me of DALL-E and Midjourney mock-ups. I'm not criticizing Apple for adopting these features, but I miss the days when we got feature-packed updates for Mac OS X. Instead, we're getting incremental features that often introduce bugs. The last time Apple focused on improving reliability was in 2018 with iOS 12. Since then, iPads have become more buggy and feel neglected. The features added in this update could be done on an iPhone or Mac, making me wonder why I would pay $1000 for an iPad Pro when a $300 iPad does the same thing.  \n",

I'm also not a fan of the color-tinted icons, which remind me of cheap icon packs from the Play Store. The new Passwords app seems useful for many users, but I already use Bitwarden, so I hope Apple doesn't push their solution on me. I'm also surprised by how prominently ChatGPT is featured, which feels un-Apple-like. I appreciate the new window snapping feature, but I'm not a fan of Stage Manager. The Settings app has become overwhelming, even with the new AI-powered navigation feature. As a software engineer and consumer, I worry about feature bloat, but I'm still excited to try out the new release.  \n",
       "14                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I was unimpressed with the new features announced for MacOS, iOS, and iPadOS. I already use 1Password and BetterTouchTool's snap functions, so Apple's new features won't add value to my daily use. I did find Apple's neglect of virtual desktop handling in MacOS disappointing. I recently traded in my iPad Pro for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+, which offers better value and similar specs. I switched to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4 phone, which provides a unique folding design that I prefer. Apple's announcement that my iPad Pro wouldn't receive iOS 18 was no surprise. The features showcased didn't excite me, as I've already moved away from iOS. I'm not a fan of large phones, but the Fold 4's compact design when folded makes it suitable for me. While Apple makes great hardware, they offer few incentives for users to upgrade. Without engaging software features, I'm unlikely to upgrade my phone or tablet. Samsung's OneUI software allows me to customize its features to my liking, making me feel like I can make it mine. I'm no longer an Apple consumer, except for my Mac, which I will continue to use.  "

I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri.\\n2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap.\\n3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat.\\n4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.  \\n5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.)\\n6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.)\\n\\nI get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.</td>\n",

I'm also not a fan of the color-tinted icons, which remind me of cheap icon packs from the Play Store.

       "      <td>My takeaway was that across MacOS, iOS and iPadOS I found very few things that I could tell I would include in my daily use.\\n\\nI already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions. \\n\\nI could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter!\\n\\nI just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro. \\n\\nThis came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\"\\n\\nI already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup. \\n\\nApple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels.\\n\\nSoftwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works.\\n\\nSo, I'm out, except for Mac.</td>\n",

I already use 1Password and BetterTouchTool's snap functions, so Apple's new features won't add value to my daily use. I did find Apple's neglect of virtual desktop handling in MacOS disappointing. I recently traded in my iPad Pro for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+, which offers better value and similar specs. I switched to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4 phone, which provides a unique folding design that I prefer. Apple's announcement that my iPad Pro wouldn't receive iOS 18 was no surprise. The features showcased didn't excite me, as I've already moved away from iOS. I'm not a fan of large phones, but the Fold 4's compact design when folded makes it suitable for me. While Apple makes great hardware, they offer few incentives for users to upgrade. Without engaging software features, I'm unlikely to upgrade my phone or tablet. Samsung's OneUI software allows me to customize its features to my liking, making me feel like I can make it mine. I'm no longer an Apple consumer, except for my Mac, which I will continue to use.</td>\n",

There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance:\\n\\n1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri.\\n2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap.\\n3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat.\\n4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.  \\n5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.)\\n6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.)\\n\\nI get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.   \n",
       "11664  My takeaway was that across MacOS, iOS and iPadOS I found very few things that I could tell I would include in my daily use.\\n\\nI already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions. \\n\\nI could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter!\\n\\nI just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro. \\n\\nThis came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\"\\n\\nI already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup. \\n\\nApple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels.\\n\\nSoftwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works.\\n\\nSo, I'm out, except for Mac.   \n",

       "11664  I was unimpressed with the new features announced for MacOS, iOS, and iPadOS. I already use 1Password and BetterTouchTool's snap functions, so Apple's new features won't add value to my daily use. I did find Apple's neglect of virtual desktop handling in MacOS disappointing. I recently traded in my iPad Pro for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+, which offers better value and similar specs. I switched to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4 phone, which provides a unique folding design that I prefer. Apple's announcement that my iPad Pro wouldn't receive iOS 18 was no surprise. The features showcased didn't excite me, as I've already moved away from iOS. I'm not a fan of large phones, but the Fold 4's compact design when folded makes it suitable for me. While Apple makes great hardware, they offer few incentives for users to upgrade. Without engaging software features, I'm unlikely to upgrade my phone or tablet. Samsung's OneUI software allows me to customize its features to my liking, making me feel like I can make it mine. I'm no longer an Apple consumer, except for my Mac, which I will continue to use.   \n",
