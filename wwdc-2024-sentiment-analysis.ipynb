Me for example with the 14 Pro, having a neural engine on the A16 chip, wouldn’t be able to use those features anyway, because the neural engine is too slow to process on device..? I’d like to know how they plan on doing things in this regard, will they leave all users with older devices behind..</td>\n",

       "7526  Thanks MKBHD! But one question that bothers me, what about all Apple devices before the A17 Pro Chip? How is Apple considering those regarding the new Apple Intelligence, is Siri gonna stay dumb? Do they adopt some features? I can’t imagine how this works.  Me for example with the 14 Pro, having a neural engine on the A16 chip, wouldn’t be able to use those features anyway, because the neural engine is too slow to process on device..? I’d like to know how they plan on doing things in this regard, will they leave all users with older devices behind..   \n",

We’re finally going to see bumps in ram and processing power and all of these hyper powerful Apple Silicon chips are finally going to be put to actual work. They’ve been impressive so far, But now we’re going to really see what they’re made of and I’m pretty excited for that.\\n\\nAs a former android diehard user, I’ve come to really appreciate that while Apple “takes a long time“ to implement things that are available on android, all those features are fairly irrelevant in the grand scheme of the stability of the devices.\\n\\nAnother take away I’m so excited that I ended up getting a 24 GB M3 MacBook Air, instead of the 8 GB model. I had a feeling it would shift this year. \\n\\nAside from all of that? I’m really excited for RCS messaging. I have a lot of android friends still and I really don’t want to use WhatsApp so we’ve all just been using SMS., I'm really impressed by the continuity features, I'm most of the way into the Apple ecosystem, I use a personal Mac, iPad, Apple TV, and even a work iPhone (plus everyone else in my life has an iPhone so...) \\n\\nHowever, I've used an Android as my personal phone for nearly 15 years now, and do really enjoy android. And since the majority of the day I'm on my work PC, I like that it has always been a pretty good middle man between the Mac and Windows world. \\n\\nBut hot damn, just the iPhone Mirroring feature alone makes me think I'm finally going to make the switch to the iPhone side. And there's ton of other really impressive stuff they announced. \\nGG Apple., as always, the video i needed for a chill summary of what was actaully important about apple news...100% - looking forward to the iphone 16 launch with ai. it seemed like there was some ai stuff that was useless to most people, and others that were really creative and useful that i would have never thought of. i think wether ai gets to super intelligence or not, it will get better, and at least in the next few years we can expect devices that can connect to other devices and literaly answer emails quickly by voice etc. and make daily life way more efficient by many leaps. the fact apple talked about chat gpt and its connection with them is interesting. but considering, every single major tech company just randomly so happened to release ai software all within the same couple months (more or less) im sure we will be seeing alot more it. the biggest thing i predict is that companies will merge technology and we will live in a city, or state, or possibly world, that all runs off the same network and systems by the same company that uses all the same products etc.  so no more apple vs samsung vs whatever. the only devices youll be able to get are the ones that exist which will eventually only be who ever creates the most cost affordable and best product. i understand company diversity creates sustainability i guess but though im sure there will be greed involved in any new societal change as such, i think it would be beneficial. around that time i think a universal basic income is likely also. but such ideas have to be slide in under the rug as not to upset a nation enough to cause issues. anyways im gonna go smoke agian.]</td>\n",

And it's unlucky that it supports the last four generations of M chips, but only one generation of iPhone chip. Well it will actually be two by the time it's ready.\\n\\nBut we were happily living without it until now. Newer iPhones having it doesn't suddenly make your iPhone any worse than it currently is.\\n\\nAnd I think some people might overrate how often would they actually use it. Let's use our brains while we still can. We will be looking back at these \"good old times\" one day thinking how good it was when everything wasn't done by AI yet.

       "0    [My biggest Takeaway from all of this is that we’re about to enter a new era of iOS/iPadOS/macOS. We’re finally going to see bumps in ram and processing power and all of these hyper powerful Apple Silicon chips are finally going to be put to actual work. They’ve been impressive so far, But now we’re going to really see what they’re made of and I’m pretty excited for that.\\n\\nAs a former android diehard user, I’ve come to really appreciate that while Apple “takes a long time“ to implement things that are available on android, all those features are fairly irrelevant in the grand scheme of the stability of the devices.\\n\\nAnother take away I’m so excited that I ended up getting a 24 GB M3 MacBook Air, instead of the 8 GB model. I had a feeling it would shift this year. \\n\\nAside from all of that? I’m really excited for RCS messaging. I have a lot of android friends still and I really don’t want to use WhatsApp so we’ve all just been using SMS., I'm really impressed by the continuity features, I'm most of the way into the Apple ecosystem, I use a personal Mac, iPad, Apple TV, and even a work iPhone (plus everyone else in my life has an iPhone so...) \\n\\nHowever, I've used an Android as my personal phone for nearly 15 years now, and do really enjoy android. And since the majority of the day I'm on my work PC, I like that it has always been a pretty good middle man between the Mac and Windows world. \\n\\nBut hot damn, just the iPhone Mirroring feature alone makes me think I'm finally going to make the switch to the iPhone side. And there's ton of other really impressive stuff they announced. \\nGG Apple., as always, the video i needed for a chill summary of what was actaully important about apple news...100% - looking forward to the iphone 16 launch with ai. it seemed like there was some ai stuff that was useless to most people, and others that were really creative and useful that i would have never thought of. i think wether ai gets to super intelligence or not, it will get better, and at least in the next few years we can expect devices that can connect to other devices and literaly answer emails quickly by voice etc. and make daily life way more efficient by many leaps. the fact apple talked about chat gpt and its connection with them is interesting. but considering, every single major tech company just randomly so happened to release ai software all within the same couple months (more or less) im sure we will be seeing alot more it. the biggest thing i predict is that companies will merge technology and we will live in a city, or state, or possibly world, that all runs off the same network and systems by the same company that uses all the same products etc.  so no more apple vs samsung vs whatever. the only devices youll be able to get are the ones that exist which will eventually only be who ever creates the most cost affordable and best product. i understand company diversity creates sustainability i guess but though im sure there will be greed involved in any new societal change as such, i think it would be beneficial. around that time i think a universal basic income is likely also. but such ideas have to be slide in under the rug as not to upset a nation enough to cause issues. anyways im gonna go smoke agian.]  \n",

What about homepod? What about home? Will existing homepods be trash? Or will they be partially upgraded, will there be a new one for a better siri experience?, So how about homepods in combination with AI Siri? If I have a ‘smart’ Siri on my Mac and iPhone, will I still have dumb siri on my homepods? (And will my mac and iPhone laugh in her face?), what about siri on HomePods?]  \n",

I expect to at least get these features through cloud AI, you just don’t talk for 40 minutes about awesome new AI for the people, when the ”people” isn’t even everyone on the latest gen iPhone, Yes it is a big feature. And it's unlucky that it supports the last four generations of M chips, but only one generation of iPhone chip. Well it will actually be two by the time it's ready.\\n\\nBut we were happily living without it until now. Newer iPhones having it doesn't suddenly make your iPhone any worse than it currently is.\\n\\nAnd I think some people might overrate how often would they actually use it. Let's use our brains while we still can. We will be looking back at these \"good old times\" one day thinking how good it was when everything wasn't done by AI yet. It will just be boring when every message, email etc. will be generated with one click.]  \n",

In the same way how my father felt about smartphones, when he was upgrading from his reliable flip phone held together by a rubber band., So first of all we nèed something new like take time and comw with somethig unimaginable like we see all this stuff many time even in many affordable phones, something like phone do some medical test or phone understand our habit and make it more easier fot us, something which help us in our studys or in work ik there r lots of things but not all r perfect even near to perfect]  \n",

       "      <td>[So I can’t use my iPhone 15 with ai💀💀, as always, the video i needed for a chill summary of what was actaully important about apple news...100% - looking forward to the iphone 16 launch with ai. it seemed like there was some ai stuff that was useless to most people, and others that were really creative and useful that i would have never thought of. i think wether ai gets to super intelligence or not, it will get better, and at least in the next few years we can expect devices that can connect to other devices and literaly answer emails quickly by voice etc. and make daily life way more efficient by many leaps. the fact apple talked about chat gpt and its connection with them is interesting. but considering, every single major tech company just randomly so happened to release ai software all within the same couple months (more or less) im sure we will be seeing alot more it. the biggest thing i predict is that companies will merge technology and we will live in a city, or state, or possibly world, that all runs off the same network and systems by the same company that uses all the same products etc.  so no more apple vs samsung vs whatever. the only devices youll be able to get are the ones that exist which will eventually only be who ever creates the most cost affordable and best product. i understand company diversity creates sustainability i guess but though im sure there will be greed involved in any new societal change as such, i think it would be beneficial. around that time i think a universal basic income is likely also. but such ideas have to be slide in under the rug as not to upset a nation enough to cause issues. anyways im gonna go smoke agian., I ditched iPhone a couple years ago to use Samsung because I use Windows PC's and don't like MacOS. But I still like to watch videos like these to keep up with what they're doing. Very cool what they are doing. I can't believe it took them until 2024 to allow people to customize icons on the home screen, though. Btw, I like how Marques reads his list off his Ultra phone. Samsung phones really are great. Can you multitask yet on an iPhone or is it still one app at a time kind of thing? Vision Pro looks really cool. I might be enticed to come back to Apple.]</td>\n",

What a day, this was probably the most jam packed WWDC I have watched in a long time. They definitely went deeper on integration that I thought they would. Hats off to the developers working crazy hours to make the features announced a reality., Summarized by AskTube\\n\\nWWDC Keynote Highlights 📱\\n00:02 Apple's WWDC keynote was filled with exciting announcements, including a surprise introduction to AI in the second half.\\n\\n00:25 The author live-tweeted the event and summarizes all the key announcements and thoughts.\\n\\nVision OS 2.0 📊\\n00:47 Vision OS 2.0 brings new features like wrist-turn gestures to see time and battery percentage, and quick access to the control center.\\n\\n01:05 New Immersive Media Features: Turn old photos into spatial photos using advanced machine learning, and create spatial videos on non-iPhone cameras.\\n\\niOS Updates 📱\\n02:29 iOS got a major update with customizable home screens, icon placement, and a new theme engine.\\n\\n02:54 Customize your home screen with different colors, and change icon and widget colors to match your wallpaper.\\n\\nOther Updates 📊\\n03:37 Mac mirroring gets a higher resolution, and new tools are available for creating spatial and immersive videos.\\n\\n04:00 New features include scheduling text messages, text formatting, a game mode that minimizes background activity, and automatic categorization in the new mail app.\\n\\nAirPods and Apple TV Updates 🎧\\n06:05 AirPods got minor updates, including voice isolation during phone calls, spatial audio during games, and nodding or shaking for responding to prompts.\\n\\n06:25 Apple TV updates include showing actors' and characters' names on screen and boosting people's voices over the music.\\n\\niPad OS Updates 📊\\n06:41 iPad OS allows remote control of someone's iPad with their permission, perfect for family tech support.\\n\\n07:03 The calculator app on iPad OS is impressive, letting you write equations in handwriting and getting real-time answers.\\n\\nMac OS Updates 📊\\n09:40 Mac OS got a new version called Sequoia, featuring automatic window snapping, built-in backgrounds for webcam feeds, and a new password app.\\n\\nApple Intelligence AI 🤖\\n10:40 Apple rebranded AI as Apple Intelligence, bringing new generative models and large language models to supported devices.\\n\\n11:01 Apple Intelligence features include writing tools, a cleanup tool in Photos, and generative emojis.\\n\\nHow Apple Handles Complex AI Tasks 💻\\n15:10 Apple handles most AI tasks on-device, using Apple-built models for faster processing.

It's just a misleading, trendy marketing term for machine learning, large language models, and a few other standard technologies put together., I actually appreciate that Apple refuses to call this technology \"A.I.\", because it definitively, unequivocably is *not* \"artificial intelligence\". I'm not saying the technology isn't interesting and potentially useful (if implemented ethically, which currently none of it is), but it's not \"A.I.\" It shows a streak of integrity from Apple that they would not succumb to marketing hype to literally lie to people about the tech.\\n\\nI'm also impressed that they managed to find a marketing spin that allowed them to draw in all the folks who've fallen for the false terminology while still creating a phrase that doesn't, technically, call it \"artificial intelligence\".\\n\\nI genuinely wish Silicon Valley would just drop \"A.I.\" from its spin machine and get another name for this tech, so it stops getting conflated with the actual science of developing true A.I., It is mildly pleasing that Apple seems to know the difference between artificial intelligence and machine \"learning\". However, being clever at marketing it uses its brand name, beginning with 'A' and links it the broad term \"intelligence\".\\nThus, the craze for muddled ideas about what AI is, in strict definitions, can continue and Apple gets to claim a slice of the whole shebang with clever electronics seeming to be new when they are really extensions/evolution of machine \"learning\". \\nThere is no dishonesty, merely more colorful and responsive fog and a significant step forward to the demise of x-86.]</td>\n",

needed for a chill summary of what was actaully important about apple news...100% - looking forward to the iphone 16 launch with ai. it seemed like there was some ai stuff that was useless to most people, and others that were really creative and useful that i would have never thought of. i think wether ai gets to super intelligence or not, it will get better, and at least in the next few years we can expect devices that can connect to other devices and literaly answer emails quickly by voice etc. and make daily life way more efficient by many leaps. the fact apple talked about chat gpt and its connection with them is interesting. but considering, every single major tech company just randomly so happened to release ai software all within the same couple months (more or less) im sure we will be seeing alot more it. the biggest thing i predict is that companies will merge technology and we will live in a city, or state, or possibly world, that all runs off the same network and systems by the same company that uses all the same products etc.  so no more apple vs samsung vs whatever. the only devices youll be able to get are the ones that exist which will eventually only be who ever creates the most cost affordable and best product. i understand company diversity creates sustainability i guess but though im sure there will be greed involved in any new societal change as such, i think it would be beneficial. around that time i think a universal basic income is likely also. but such ideas have to be slide in under the rug as not to upset a nation enough to cause issues. anyways im gonna go smoke agian., I ditched iPhone a couple years ago to use Samsung because I use Windows PC's and don't like MacOS. But I still like to watch videos like these to keep up with what they're doing. Very cool what they are doing. I can't believe it took them until 2024 to allow people to customize icons on the home screen, though. Btw, I like how Marques reads his list off his Ultra phone. Samsung phones really are great. Can you multitask yet on an iPhone or is it still one app at a time kind of thing? Vision Pro looks really cool. I might be enticed to come back to Apple.]  \n",

Would i need to keep both? Could i potentially cancel my plan with gpt? Would the capabilities on both be different (Siri AI vs gpt)?, so many questions, biggest one is if you pay for a premium chat gpt account do you get enhanced features? or more importantly is the version incorprated into ios just standard chat gpt 3,0? because if the iphone can use chat gpt 4.0 as standard whats the point in getting a premium account with open ai?, chat gpt 4 yes finally!!]  \n",

            [I always respected Apple for not calling everything AI, because absolutely NOTHING being marketing as \"Artificial Intelligence\" is actually intelligence. It's just a misleading, trendy marketing term for machine learning, large language models, and a few other standard technologies put together., I actually appreciate that Apple refuses to call this technology \"A.I.\", because it definitively, unequivocably is *not* \"artificial intelligence\". I'm not saying the technology isn't interesting and potentially useful (if implemented ethically, which currently none of it is), but it's not \"A.I.\" It shows a streak of integrity from Apple that they would not succumb to marketing hype to literally lie to people about the tech.\\n\\nI'm also impressed that they managed to find a marketing spin that allowed them to draw in all the folks who've fallen for the false terminology while still creating a phrase that doesn't, technically, call it \"artificial intelligence\".\\n\\nI genuinely wish Silicon Valley would just drop \"A.I.\" from its spin machine and get another name for this tech, so it stops getting conflated with the actual science of developing true A.I., It is mildly pleasing that Apple seems to know the difference between artificial intelligence and machine \"learning\". However, being clever at marketing it uses its brand name, beginning with 'A' and links it the broad term \"intelligence\".\\nThus, the craze for muddled ideas about what AI is, in strict definitions, can continue and Apple gets to claim a slice of the whole shebang with clever electronics seeming to be new when they are really extensions/evolution of machine \"learning\". \\nThere is no dishonesty, merely more colorful and responsive fog and a significant step forward to the demise of x-86.]  \n",

       "      <td>my take on wwdc's ipad calculator app: it's nothing more than a gimmick wwdc just dropped yesterday and one of the highlight features was the calculator app feature. mkbhd, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the ipad. but like almost every other hyped software/ai update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world. ok, let’s dive into the main math notes features that everyone is so excited about and i will explain why they are all useless gimmicks: it’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. you can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly. it can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want. you can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers. the features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. what is the real-world context? in this case, apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? you are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. so how does it compare to classroom tools? the first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. this feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. the maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. it’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? in maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  in this case, how does the ipad even come in handy? you may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. the physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. a physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an ipad and hoping that the ai will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the maths notes app. there is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the ti-nspire   that calculator simply blows the ipad out of the water in so many ways. the functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your ipad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the ipad. the second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. i don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. the cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. you can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. does apple not know free amazing software like geogebra and desmos exist? they have way more features than the maths notes and are free. they are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. you don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an ipad to get access to those features. all of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. the physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the ipad calculator when it comes to doing maths. the features on the ipad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. this reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. there are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. there are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. these robots are good at what they do. but why do we not find them impressive? instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. the reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). it’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. in the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. the chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. other examples include the samsung ai features. i got my ai update on my z fold 4 not long ago and i have rarely used them. i tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. i used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people i know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.</td>\n",

       "      <td>i will never understand these chucklefucks trying to sell vr as a productivity tool at this stage in its development. like, how heavy and cumbersome is apple vision or an oculus headset? three pounds? four pounds? heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, i really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a vr toaster strapped to their face. ==================================== my requirements for a phone are actually quite simple:  -a camera with acceptable image quality -no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display -stereo front-facing speakers -a headphone jack as backup for when i need it -expandable storage for when i need it -the ability to make my home screen look like palm's webos thus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iphone. ==================================== okay, i will admit that the new calculator app on ipad os 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of ocr and ai interpretation that i've seen in a while. it wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see. ==================================== i honestly wish i could care about all of these ai features, but i really don't. an enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but ai has repeatedly demonstrated that the english language is quite a challenge for it. photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. i'd be most interested in them applying ai to properly optimize the shot in the first place. couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use ai and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the light camera could do. the ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even google can't offer yet. ==================================== i'm a bit disappointed that apple didn't make any announcements about their totl mac products, so there's no official news yet about an m3 or m4 ultra chip or the next generation of mac pro. content creators who rely heavily on mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these totl apple silicon powered devices will be available.</td>\n",

       "      <td>my takeaway was that across macos, ios and ipados i found very few things that i could tell i would include in my daily use. i already use 1password so apple passwords is not useful for me. i can already do corner splits with bettertouchtool's snap functions.  i could have used something like improvements to macos virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. it's one feature i use every day that is woefully forgotten by apple. and microsoft for that matter! i just shipped off my 2017 ipad pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a samsung galaxy tab s9+ 12.4\". that way i got most of what the 2024 ipad pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. the s9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old ipad pro.  this came at a good time right when apple announced my ipad pro would not have gotten ios 18 anyway. not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"i want that!\" i already moved away from ios to the samsung galaxy fold 4. with the discontinuation of the iphone mini line, i was left to pick from what i wanted to get away from - phones larger than i'd like! i like the fold because when folded it is similar width to the iphone 12 mini i was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. it has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works i really do love the foldable thing and apple has nothing like that in their lineup.  apple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. i could easily be using something as old as the iphone xs and not feel like i'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iphone pro unless i'm really into photography. great for a consumer, but not good business. we have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels. softwarewise, samsung oneui allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like i can make it mine instead of adapting to what apple thinks is good. i'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works. so, i'm out, except for mac.</td>\n",

       "      <td>**lots** of great updates. there's so much to process. there are a handful of things that i didn't really like at first glance: 1. all of the generative features. i didn't like how microsoft started baking them into their software, and i don't really like them here. can't place my finger on *why.* i feel like the siri features are more essential for me. i'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced siri. 2. the color-tinted icons. the effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the play store years ago. a developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. i feel as though apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap. 3. the passwords app. i get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. that said, i use bitwarden. i really hope apple doesn't begin to shove their password solution down my throat. 4. how blatantly chatgpt branding is baked into the user-experience. like, *whaaaat*? it feels very un-apple to me. i love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on ios — if you've ever tried to google something from spotlight, you probably know my pain — but i **can** have an os-level supported chatgpt conversation with chatgpt branding? wild.   5. (honestly, i'm glad they brought window snapping to mac os. that feature has been missing for so, so long. stage manager is not for me and never will be. that said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my swish + alt-tab setup. hopefully i don't have to fight with these new os features to continue using those tools.) 6. (i find it ironic that the settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of apple’s flagship llm to… navigate through settings. not a complaint about the ai feature. seems good. i’ll use it. i just feel that the settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.) i get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a software engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. that said, i’m very interested to get my hands on this release.</td>\n",

       "      <td>i want to thank you for always giving us a well thought videos. others spend time babbling and trying to be funny and you sound like a tech guy giving us tech news. i have a suggestion to take you to a new level. i have been writing apple for years. i honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. i’ll share them in a moment. by the way i am a software engineer. i am not one who thinks i am so d smart or the smarted person in the room. i love to always learn and ai find i am always learning new things from you. so my idea for you is a real tech news channel. this will make you something like the wal mart of tech news. this idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. i tried to float this to apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. we have cnn, nbc news, abc news, cbs news and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iphone is released. tech news is happening every day all day. i say join forces with some of the best like yourself, brian tong, possibly some from engadget and create a real tech news channel. it’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. evs and republicans wanting to k evs, tictok, twitter. with social media companies being as influential as they have become. they’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. a real tech news channel will do this. what you and others do is journalism. i want the news to still be fun but i want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a cnn. you will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech ceo’s. it’s a militia billion. dollar idea i am giving to you. this is something new of its kind and needed. tech is no longer just mobile. we have stepped into the world of ai and humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will i pack them. i would love to work with you as a producer or something. i have a huge idea and it will work.</td>\n",

in this case, apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? you are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. so how does it compare to classroom tools? the first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. this feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. the maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. it’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? in maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  in this case, how does the ipad even come in handy? you may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. the physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. a physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an ipad and hoping that the ai will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the maths notes app. there is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the ti-nspire   that calculator simply blows the ipad out of the water in so many ways. the functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your ipad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the ipad. the second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. i don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. the cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. you can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. does apple not know free amazing software like geogebra and desmos exist? they have way more features than the maths notes and are free. they are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. you don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an ipad to get access to those features. all of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. the physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the ipad calculator when it comes to doing maths. the features on the ipad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. this reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. there are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. there are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. these robots are good at what they do. but why do we not find them impressive? instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. the reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). it’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. in the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. the chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. other examples include the samsung ai features. i got my ai update on my z fold 4 not long ago and i have rarely used them. i tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. i used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people i know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.  \n",

three pounds? four pounds? heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, i really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a vr toaster strapped to their face. ==================================== my requirements for a phone are actually quite simple:  -a camera with acceptable image quality -no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display -stereo front-facing speakers -a headphone jack as backup for when i need it -expandable storage for when i need it -the ability to make my home screen look like palm's webos thus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iphone. ==================================== okay, i will admit that the new calculator app on ipad os 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of ocr and ai interpretation that i've seen in a while. it wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see. ==================================== i honestly wish i could care about all of these ai features, but i really don't. an enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but ai has repeatedly demonstrated that the english language is quite a challenge for it. photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. i'd be most interested in them applying ai to properly optimize the shot in the first place. couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use ai and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the light camera could do. the ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even google can't offer yet. ==================================== i'm a bit disappointed that apple didn't make any announcements about their totl mac products, so there's no official news yet about an m3 or m4 ultra chip or the next generation of mac pro. content creators who rely heavily on mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these totl apple silicon powered devices will be available.  \n",

intelligence ai 🤖 10:40 apple rebranded ai as apple intelligence, bringing new generative models and large language models to supported devices. 11:01 apple intelligence features include writing tools, a cleanup tool in photos, and generative emojis. how apple handles complex ai tasks 💻 15:10 apple handles most ai tasks on-device, using apple-built models for faster processing. however, for complex tasks, apple has two alternative approaches. 15:32 one approach uses a larger server-based model on apple's private cloud compute, ensuring data is not stored or sent to apple, but may have downsides like slower processing and internet dependence. 15:54 the other approach asks the user for permission to use chatgpt, allowing access to its capabilities and generating more realistic and varied images. privacy and security of ai features 🔒 16:18 apple ensures privacy and security by not storing requests, obscuring ip addresses, and preventing openai from forming a profile. all this is done without an account and for free. insights on apple's ai announcements 🤔 17:01 the author believes apple's ai features are superior, with personalization and existing user info making them more effective. 17:25 the ai announcements overshadow other features, marking a new age for apple, and the author is excited to explore its capabilities and what it can bring to users. conclusion and future content 📹 18:06 the author will create more videos about apple's ai features and encourages viewers to subscribe for updates.  \n",

i just shipped off my 2017 ipad pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a samsung galaxy tab s9+ 12.4\". that way i got most of what the 2024 ipad pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. the s9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old ipad pro.  this came at a good time right when apple announced my ipad pro would not have gotten ios 18 anyway. not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"i want that!\" i already moved away from ios to the samsung galaxy fold 4. with the discontinuation of the iphone mini line, i was left to pick from what i wanted to get away from - phones larger than i'd like! i like the fold because when folded it is similar width to the iphone 12 mini i was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. it has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works i really do love the foldable thing and apple has nothing like that in their lineup.  apple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. i could easily be using something as old as the iphone xs and not feel like i'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iphone pro unless i'm really into photography. great for a consumer, but not good business. we have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels. softwarewise, samsung oneui allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like i can make it mine instead of adapting to what apple thinks is good. i'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works. so, i'm out, except for mac.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         **lots** of great updates. there's so much to process. there are a handful of things that i didn't really like at first glance: 1. all of the generative features. i didn't like how microsoft started baking them into their software, and i don't really like them here. can't place my finger on *why.* i feel like the siri features are more essential for me. i'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced siri. 2. the color-tinted icons. the effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the play store years ago. a developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. i feel as though apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap. 3. the passwords app. i get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. that said, i use bitwarden. i really hope apple doesn't begin to shove their password solution down my throat. 4. how blatantly chatgpt branding is baked into the user-experience. like, *whaaaat*? it feels very un-apple to me. i love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on ios — if you've ever tried to google something from spotlight, you probably know my pain — but i **can** have an os-level supported chatgpt conversation with chatgpt branding? wild.   5. (honestly, i'm glad they brought window snapping to mac os. that feature has been missing for so, so long. stage manager is not for me and never will be. that said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my swish + alt-tab setup. hopefully i don't have to fight with these new os features to continue using those tools.) 6. (i find it ironic that the settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of apple’s flagship llm to… navigate through settings. not a complaint about the ai feature. seems good. i’ll use it. i just feel that the settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.) i get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a software engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. that said, i’m very interested to get my hands on this release.  \n",

both past, present, and future sins. shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. after dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to heaven. to show life after death. to show everlasting life through jesus's sacrifice. john 14:6 states: \"jesus saith unto him, i am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the father, but by me.\". romans 10:13 states \"for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved.\". \\r \\r    eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. all you have to do is believe that jesus christ, the son of god, died on the cross for your sins. as an atonement for your sins. and rose from the grave on the 3rd day. ask jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in heaven. salvation is a free and everlasting gift from god. please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in hell, but ask jesus to give you eternal life in heaven. if you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because satan doesn't want you to get saved. he wants you to resist, and think it's not real. he wants you in hell for all eternity with him. hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. it's everlasting torture with no relief. i'm only taking the time to text this, because i want to get the message out. there are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. keeping people from thinking about salvation. keeping you from thinking about life after death. please, ask jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. ask him for a place in heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in hell.  \n",

                                                           not only that, for most of the presentation they did say that iphone would have apple intelligence and in the end they said only iphone 15 pro models, is like... 😂 okay apple, not all people can afford a 1100 and 1300 dollars usd smartphones, thanks, steve jobs said that apple is for the humanity and to give them technology to improve people's lifes, apple had vision, tim cook did it until 2018, then everything has go slowly downhill, not all of it of course, but very down, not only that, but jobs said that according to our efforts we decide the price of our products, we try the most to price it correctly, well that was in 2009, and for your knowledge, apple intelligence is only available for 2 iphones (of more than 24 iphones eligible for the ios 18 update *oh is because they don't have 6gb of ram, well darling the android phone of my granny costs 200 dollars and has 8gb of ddr4 ram and on screen ai analysis to summarize websites with gemini for free -well you exchange your data even when they say no but i don't believe any company in terms of 100% privacy so it's meh for me, is logic, that's why usa gov wants to ban tiktok cuz they don't have control over their info and the excuse is that they are \"spies\"-, apple does not use a \"unique physical ram\" to justify their price, like i say.. thefts*) but hey you have good animations :d and \"the ecosystem\" that windows and android are reaching more fast than ever to the point of apple, apple= no moral and respectful for people's money and time (so contrary to steve's apple), yeah they have good and incredible things like the integration of apple intelligence offline but it doesn't help the fact that whenever they do something great they put it like god's new technology to justify prices in this times when they are not the unique smartphone company they were in 2007-2018, others are in the same level or little lower or little higher than them in terms of technology, i hope that the apple directive is changed but that will not happen because money runs the world and if they are still selling, nothing will change.  p.d. they said thar a17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really? they always said new processors of apple silicon are the most fastest in the world all the time, the processor of the iphone 14 pro max is slow? gosh they are really inmoral capitalists (i agree with capitalism and liberal economies)  \n",

definitely that they’re playing catch-up, in terms of qol features. they could’ve done this back in ios 14 at once, there’s no reason to take 4 years to incorporate all these features. summarization was already available on mac, i’ve sent numerous feature requests, asking them to bring it system-wide to ipads and iphones. this was also the case for increasing options for tapback in imessage (like in whatsapp, and telegram). and, google photos already does the features which apple just adopted. and amazon already has insight features called x-ray. i predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see ipad becoming more powerful, and hopefully files app being reformed. this years wwdc just proves that.  the only original features i see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like dall-e/ midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “sketch”.  this isn’t to criticize apple for finally adopting these features, but i miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for macos x. nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. there were definitely years when apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability.  last time we got that was in 2018, with ios 12. since then, ipads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected.  furthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an ipad can most likely be done better on an iphone or the mac.  - why would i pay $1000 for the ipad pro when the $300 ipad does the same thing?  another thing, is the fact that i want to highlight is all the features macs got: - better app organizing into windows (windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to mac many years ago) - other features which are ported from the iphone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iphone in mind.  a few days ago, quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how apple failed to address the glaring issues with ipads.  \n",

                                                     i want to thank you for always giving us a well thought videos. others spend time babbling and trying to be funny and you sound like a tech guy giving us tech news. i have a suggestion to take you to a new level. i have been writing apple for years. i honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. i’ll share them in a moment. by the way i am a software engineer. i am not one who thinks i am so d smart or the smarted person in the room. i love to always learn and ai find i am always learning new things from you. so my idea for you is a real tech news channel. this will make you something like the wal mart of tech news. this idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. i tried to float this to apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. we have cnn, nbc news, abc news, cbs news and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iphone is released. tech news is happening every day all day. i say join forces with some of the best like yourself, brian tong, possibly some from engadget and create a real tech news channel. it’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. evs and republicans wanting to k evs, tictok, twitter. with social media companies being as influential as they have become. they’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. a real tech news channel will do this. what you and others do is journalism. i want the news to still be fun but i want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a cnn. you will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech ceo’s. it’s a militia billion. dollar idea i am giving to you. this is something new of its kind and needed. tech is no longer just mobile. we have stepped into the world of ai and humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will i pack them. i would love to work with you as a producer or something. i have a huge idea and it will work.

       "      <td>my take on wwdc's ipad calculator app: it's nothing more than a gimmick wwdc just dropped yesterday and one of the highlight features was the calculator app feature. mkbhd, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the ipad. but like almost every other hyped software/ai update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world. ok, let’s dive into the main math notes features that everyone is so excited about and i will explain why they are all useless gimmicks: it’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. you can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly. it can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want. you can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers. the features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. what is the real-world context? in this case, apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? you are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. so how does it compare to classroom tools? the first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. this feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. the maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. it’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? in maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  in this case, how does the ipad even come in handy? you may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. the physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. a physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an ipad and hoping that the ai will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the maths notes app. there is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the ti-nspire   that calculator simply blows the ipad out of the water in so many ways. the functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your ipad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the ipad. the second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. i don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. the cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. you can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. does apple not know free amazing software like geogebra and desmos exist? they have way more features than the maths notes and are free. they are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. you don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an ipad to get access to those features. all of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. the physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the ipad calculator when it comes to doing maths. the features on the ipad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. this reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. there are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. there are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. these robots are good at what they do. but why do we not find them impressive? instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. the reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). it’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. in the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. the chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. other examples include the samsung ai features. i got my ai update on my z fold 4 not long ago and i have rarely used them. i tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. i used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people i know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.</td>\n",

       "      <td>i will never understand these chucklefucks trying to sell vr as a productivity tool at this stage in its development. like, how heavy and cumbersome is apple vision or an oculus headset? three pounds? four pounds? heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, i really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a vr toaster strapped to their face. ==================================== my requirements for a phone are actually quite simple:  -a camera with acceptable image quality -no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display -stereo front-facing speakers -a headphone jack as backup for when i need it -expandable storage for when i need it -the ability to make my home screen look like palm's webos thus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iphone. ==================================== okay, i will admit that the new calculator app on ipad os 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of ocr and ai interpretation that i've seen in a while. it wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see. ==================================== i honestly wish i could care about all of these ai features, but i really don't. an enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but ai has repeatedly demonstrated that the english language is quite a challenge for it. photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. i'd be most interested in them applying ai to properly optimize the shot in the first place. couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use ai and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the light camera could do. the ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even google can't offer yet. ==================================== i'm a bit disappointed that apple didn't make any announcements about their totl mac products, so there's no official news yet about an m3 or m4 ultra chip or the next generation of mac pro. content creators who rely heavily on mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these totl apple silicon powered devices will be available.</td>\n",

       "      <td>my takeaway was that across macos, ios and ipados i found very few things that i could tell i would include in my daily use. i already use 1password so apple passwords is not useful for me. i can already do corner splits with bettertouchtool's snap functions.  i could have used something like improvements to macos virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. it's one feature i use every day that is woefully forgotten by apple. and microsoft for that matter! i just shipped off my 2017 ipad pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a samsung galaxy tab s9+ 12.4\". that way i got most of what the 2024 ipad pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. the s9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old ipad pro.  this came at a good time right when apple announced my ipad pro would not have gotten ios 18 anyway. not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"i want that!\" i already moved away from ios to the samsung galaxy fold 4. with the discontinuation of the iphone mini line, i was left to pick from what i wanted to get away from - phones larger than i'd like! i like the fold because when folded it is similar width to the iphone 12 mini i was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. it has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works i really do love the foldable thing and apple has nothing like that in their lineup.  apple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. i could easily be using something as old as the iphone xs and not feel like i'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iphone pro unless i'm really into photography. great for a consumer, but not good business. we have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels. softwarewise, samsung oneui allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like i can make it mine instead of adapting to what apple thinks is good. i'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works. so, i'm out, except for mac.</td>\n",

       "      <td>**lots** of great updates. there's so much to process. there are a handful of things that i didn't really like at first glance: 1. all of the generative features. i didn't like how microsoft started baking them into their software, and i don't really like them here. can't place my finger on *why.* i feel like the siri features are more essential for me. i'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced siri. 2. the color-tinted icons. the effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the play store years ago. a developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. i feel as though apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap. 3. the passwords app. i get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. that said, i use bitwarden. i really hope apple doesn't begin to shove their password solution down my throat. 4. how blatantly chatgpt branding is baked into the user-experience. like, *whaaaat*? it feels very un-apple to me. i love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on ios — if you've ever tried to google something from spotlight, you probably know my pain — but i **can** have an os-level supported chatgpt conversation with chatgpt branding? wild.   5. (honestly, i'm glad they brought window snapping to mac os. that feature has been missing for so, so long. stage manager is not for me and never will be. that said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my swish + alt-tab setup. hopefully i don't have to fight with these new os features to continue using those tools.) 6. (i find it ironic that the settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of apple’s flagship llm to… navigate through settings. not a complaint about the ai feature. seems good. i’ll use it. i just feel that the settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.) i get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a software engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. that said, i’m very interested to get my hands on this release.</td>\n",

       "      <td>i want to thank you for always giving us a well thought videos. others spend time babbling and trying to be funny and you sound like a tech guy giving us tech news. i have a suggestion to take you to a new level. i have been writing apple for years. i honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. i’ll share them in a moment. by the way i am a software engineer. i am not one who thinks i am so d smart or the smarted person in the room. i love to always learn and ai find i am always learning new things from you. so my idea for you is a real tech news channel. this will make you something like the wal mart of tech news. this idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. i tried to float this to apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. we have cnn, nbc news, abc news, cbs news and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iphone is released. tech news is happening every day all day. i say join forces with some of the best like yourself, brian tong, possibly some from engadget and create a real tech news channel. it’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. evs and republicans wanting to k evs, tictok, twitter. with social media companies being as influential as they have become. they’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. a real tech news channel will do this. what you and others do is journalism. i want the news to still be fun but i want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a cnn. you will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech ceo’s. it’s a militia billion. dollar idea i am giving to you. this is something new of its kind and needed. tech is no longer just mobile. we have stepped into the world of ai and humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will i pack them. i would love to work with you as a producer or something. i have a huge idea and it will work.</td>\n",

in this case, apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? you are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. so how does it compare to classroom tools? the first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. this feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. the maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. it’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? in maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  in this case, how does the ipad even come in handy? you may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. the physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. a physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an ipad and hoping that the ai will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the maths notes app. there is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the ti-nspire   that calculator simply blows the ipad out of the water in so many ways. the functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your ipad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the ipad. the second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. i don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. the cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. you can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. does apple not know free amazing software like geogebra and desmos exist? they have way more features than the maths notes and are free. they are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. you don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an ipad to get access to those features. all of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. the physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the ipad calculator when it comes to doing maths. the features on the ipad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. this reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. there are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. there are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. these robots are good at what they do. but why do we not find them impressive? instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. the reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). it’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. in the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. the chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. other examples include the samsung ai features. i got my ai update on my z fold 4 not long ago and i have rarely used them. i tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. i used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people i know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.   \n",

three pounds? four pounds? heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, i really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a vr toaster strapped to their face. ==================================== my requirements for a phone are actually quite simple:  -a camera with acceptable image quality -no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display -stereo front-facing speakers -a headphone jack as backup for when i need it -expandable storage for when i need it -the ability to make my home screen look like palm's webos thus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iphone. ==================================== okay, i will admit that the new calculator app on ipad os 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of ocr and ai interpretation that i've seen in a while. it wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see. ==================================== i honestly wish i could care about all of these ai features, but i really don't. an enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but ai has repeatedly demonstrated that the english language is quite a challenge for it. photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. i'd be most interested in them applying ai to properly optimize the shot in the first place. couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use ai and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the light camera could do. the ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even google can't offer yet. ==================================== i'm a bit disappointed that apple didn't make any announcements about their totl mac products, so there's no official news yet about an m3 or m4 ultra chip or the next generation of mac pro. content creators who rely heavily on mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these totl apple silicon powered devices will be available.   \n",

intelligence ai 🤖 10:40 apple rebranded ai as apple intelligence, bringing new generative models and large language models to supported devices. 11:01 apple intelligence features include writing tools, a cleanup tool in photos, and generative emojis. how apple handles complex ai tasks 💻 15:10 apple handles most ai tasks on-device, using apple-built models for faster processing. however, for complex tasks, apple has two alternative approaches. 15:32 one approach uses a larger server-based model on apple's private cloud compute, ensuring data is not stored or sent to apple, but may have downsides like slower processing and internet dependence. 15:54 the other approach asks the user for permission to use chatgpt, allowing access to its capabilities and generating more realistic and varied images. privacy and security of ai features 🔒 16:18 apple ensures privacy and security by not storing requests, obscuring ip addresses, and preventing openai from forming a profile. all this is done without an account and for free. insights on apple's ai announcements 🤔 17:01 the author believes apple's ai features are superior, with personalization and existing user info making them more effective. 17:25 the ai announcements overshadow other features, marking a new age for apple, and the author is excited to explore its capabilities and what it can bring to users. conclusion and

i just shipped off my 2017 ipad pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a samsung galaxy tab s9+ 12.4\". that way i got most of what the 2024 ipad pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. the s9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old ipad pro.  this came at a good time right when apple announced my ipad pro would not have gotten ios 18 anyway. not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"i want that!\" i already moved away from ios to the samsung galaxy fold 4. with the discontinuation of the iphone mini line, i was left to pick from what i wanted to get away from - phones larger than i'd like! i like the fold because when folded it is similar width to the iphone 12 mini i was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. it has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works i really do love the foldable thing and apple has nothing like that in their lineup.  apple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. i could easily be using something as old as the iphone xs and not feel like i'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iphone pro unless i'm really into photography. great for a consumer, but not good business. we have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels. softwarewise, samsung oneui allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like i can make it mine instead of adapting to what apple thinks is good. i'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works. so, i'm out, except for mac.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         **lots** of great updates. there's so much to process. there are a handful of things that i didn't really like at first glance: 1. all of the generative features. i didn't like how microsoft started baking them into their software, and i don't really like them here. can't place my finger on *why.* i feel like the siri features are more essential for me. i'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced siri. 2. the color-tinted icons. the effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the play store years ago. a developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. i feel as though apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap. 3. the passwords app. i get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. that said, i use bitwarden. i really hope apple doesn't begin to shove their password solution down my throat. 4. how blatantly chatgpt branding is baked into the user-experience. like, *whaaaat*? it feels very un-apple to me. i love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on ios — if you've ever tried to google something from spotlight, you probably know my pain — but i **can** have an os-level supported chatgpt conversation with chatgpt branding? wild.   5. (honestly, i'm glad they brought window snapping to mac os. that feature has been missing for so, so long. stage manager is not for me and never will be. that said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my swish + alt-tab setup. hopefully i don't have to fight with these new os features to continue using those tools.) 6. (i find it ironic that the settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of apple’s flagship llm to… navigate through settings. not a complaint about the ai feature. seems good. i’ll use it. i just feel that the settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.) i get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a software engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. that said, i’m very interested to get my hands on this release.   \n",

both past, present, and future sins. shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. after dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to heaven. to show life after death. to show everlasting life through jesus's sacrifice. john 14:6 states: \"jesus saith unto him, i am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the father, but by me.\". romans 10:13 states \"for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved.\". \\r \\r    eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. all you have to do is believe that jesus christ, the son of god, died on the cross for your sins. as an atonement for your sins. and rose from the grave on the 3rd day. ask jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in heaven. salvation is a free and everlasting gift from god. please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in hell, but ask jesus to give you eternal life in heaven. if you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because satan doesn't want you to get saved. he wants you to resist, and think it's not real. he wants you in hell for all eternity with him. hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. it's everlasting torture with no relief. i'm only taking the time to text this, because i want to get the message out. there are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. keeping people from thinking about salvation. keeping you from thinking about life after death. please, ask jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. ask him for a place in heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in hell.   \n",

                                                           not only that, for most of the presentation they did say that iphone would have apple intelligence and in the end they said only iphone 15 pro models, is like... 😂 okay apple, not all people can afford a 1100 and 1300 dollars usd smartphones, thanks, steve jobs said that apple is for the humanity and to give them technology to improve people's lifes, apple had vision, tim cook did it until 2018, then everything has go slowly downhill, not all of it of course, but very down, not only that, but jobs said that according to our efforts we decide the price of our products, we try the most to price it correctly, well that was in 2009, and for your knowledge, apple intelligence is only available for 2 iphones (of more than 24 iphones eligible for the ios 18 update *oh is because they don't have 6gb of ram, well darling the android phone of my granny costs 200 dollars and has 8gb of ddr4 ram and on screen ai analysis to summarize websites with gemini for free -well you exchange your data even when they say no but i don't believe any company in terms of 100% privacy so it's meh for me, is logic, that's why usa gov wants to ban tiktok cuz they don't have control over their info and the excuse is that they are \"spies\"-, apple does not use a \"unique physical ram\" to justify their price, like i say.. thefts*) but hey you have good animations :d and \"the ecosystem\" that windows and android are reaching more fast than ever to the point of apple, apple= no moral and respectful for people's money and time (so contrary to steve's apple), yeah they have good and incredible things like the integration of apple intelligence offline but it doesn't help the fact that whenever they do something great they put it like god's new technology to justify prices in this times when they are not the unique smartphone company they were in 2007-2018, others are in the same level or little lower or little higher than them in terms of technology, i hope that the apple directive is changed but that will not happen because money runs the world and if they are still selling, nothing will change.  p.d. they said thar a17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really? they always said new processors of apple silicon are the most fastest in the world all the time, the processor of the iphone 14 pro max is slow? gosh they are really inmoral capitalists (i agree with capitalism and liberal economies)   \n",

definitely that they’re playing catch-up, in terms of qol features. they could’ve done this back in ios 14 at once, there’s no reason to take 4 years to incorporate all these features. summarization was already available on mac, i’ve sent numerous feature requests, asking them to bring it system-wide to ipads and iphones. this was also the case for increasing options for tapback in imessage (like in whatsapp, and telegram). and, google photos already does the features which apple just adopted. and amazon already has insight features called x-ray. i predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see ipad becoming more powerful, and hopefully files app being reformed. this years wwdc just proves that.  the only original features i see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like dall-e/ midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “sketch”.  this isn’t to criticize apple for finally adopting these features, but i miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for macos x. nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. there were definitely years when apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability.  last time we got that was in 2018, with ios 12. since then, ipads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected.  furthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an ipad can most likely be done better on an iphone or the mac.  - why would i pay $1000 for the ipad pro when the $300 ipad does the same thing?  another thing, is the fact that i want to highlight is all the features macs got: - better app organizing into windows (windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to mac many years ago) - other features which are ported from the iphone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iphone in mind.  a few days ago, quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how apple failed to address the glaring issues with ipads.   \n",

                                                     i want to thank you for always giving us a well thought videos. others spend time babbling and trying to be funny and you sound like a tech guy giving us tech news. i have a suggestion to take you to a new level. i have been writing apple for years. i honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. i’ll share them in a moment. by the way i am a software engineer. i am not one who thinks i am so d smart or the smarted person in the room. i love to always learn and ai find i am always learning new things from you. so my idea for you is a real tech news channel. this will make you something like the wal mart of tech news. this idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. i tried to float this to apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. we have cnn, nbc news, abc news, cbs news and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iphone is released. tech news is happening every day all day. i say join forces with some of the best like yourself, brian tong, possibly some from engadget and create a real tech news channel. it’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. evs and republicans wanting to k evs, tictok, twitter. with social media companies being as influential as they have become. they’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. a real tech news channel will do this. what you and others do is journalism. i want the news to still be fun but i want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a cnn. you will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech ceo’s. it’s a militia billion. dollar idea i am giving to you. this is something new of its kind and needed. tech is no longer just mobile. we have stepped into the world of ai and humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will i pack them. i would love to work with you as a producer or something. i have a huge idea and it will work.   \n",

I've been writing to Apple for years and believe they've used some of my ideas. I'd love to collaborate with you and others like Brian Tong and Engadget to make this channel a reality. The idea would focus on tech news, not politics, and would be a departure from the typical tech news we see today. We could hire anchors and conduct in-depth interviews with tech CEOs.

I have a suggestion to take your content to the next level: creating a 24/7 real tech news channel. This would differentiate you from other tech influencers and put some out of business. I've been writing to Apple for years and believe they've used some of my ideas. I'd love to collaborate with you and others like Brian Tong and Engadget to make this channel a reality. The idea would focus on tech news, not politics, and would be a departure from the typical tech news we see today. We could hire anchors and conduct in-depth interviews with tech CEOs. I believe this has the potential to be a billion-dollar idea and would love to work with you as a producer.\""
