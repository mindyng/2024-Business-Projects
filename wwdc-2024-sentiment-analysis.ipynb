I’m sure as shit not buying a new iPhone for this and I’m not even sure if I’m going to buy another ever. The home screen customisation and iMessage features are pretty good to being ios on par with Android. What bothers me is that people just want simple stuff from their phones. The option to put icons anywhere, a button to close all open apps, option to customise control center, etc. It’s good that Apple is finally addressing all this. From all the AI features I saw, nothing really made me go “oh this is a game changer”. I think phone operating systems have peaked., Safari don’t load websites very annoying but with chrome straight away, every year people expecting multitasking capabilities and split screen features but never came out,again Android phones have it for years, basically iPhone is trying to coping Android features that they have for years like for example widgets home screen but they do it so poorly not even close…By the way color change icons is a joke is another desperate way to allow the iPhone user to do something on icons when you have it for years a possibility the chance to change the entire icons design on Android phones. Basically what they are doing is put ther phones with the same features but take ages for a consumer get does features on iPhone that’s why people move to Android. People tired to wait years for developments, basically Apple software customization and  innovation departments in the last 10 years don’teven close what Android phones offer, even a Android phone released 10 years ago the software is more advanced compared to a brand new iPhone. All this years im still thinking IPhone can have the advanced software that Android phones have it, but Apple is doing this transition very slow so that away not being very noticeable. To be honest every person that have both phones straight away agree with me, basically if you only use Android phone you don’t understand that your phone Operating System is so blast advanced.\\nOn the other hand a person that uses only IPhone don’t understand how basic the IOS iPhone operating system it is compared to Android Operating system software looks like living in a stone age, honestly just to put you in perspective when you use Android phone feels like the Android phone user is already in 2035 at least . But don’t forget when you buy a Android phone don’t buy the cheapest one because you need at least a medium performance processor so you good on average price don’t need to be a top line or a flagship Android phone but if you can affordit better., Summarized by AskTube\\n\\nWWDC Keynote Highlights 📱\\n00:02 Apple's WWDC keynote was filled with exciting announcements, including a surprise introduction to AI in the second half.\\n\\n00:25 The author live-tweeted the event and summarizes all the key announcements and thoughts.\\n\\nVision OS 2.0 📊\\n00:47 Vision OS 2.0 brings new features like wrist-turn gestures to see time and battery percentage, and quick access to the control center.\\n\\n01:05 New Immersive Media Features: Turn old photos into spatial photos using advanced machine learning, and create spatial videos on non-iPhone cameras.\\n\\niOS Updates 📱\\n02:29 iOS got a major update with customizable home screens, icon placement, and a new theme engine.\\n\\n02:54 Customize your home screen with different colors, and change icon and widget colors to match your wallpaper.\\n\\nOther Updates 📊\\n03:37 Mac mirroring gets a higher resolution, and new tools are available for creating spatial and immersive videos.\\n\\n04:00 New features include scheduling text messages, text formatting, a game mode that minimizes background activity, and automatic categorization in the new mail app.\\n\\nAirPods and Apple TV Updates 🎧\\n06:05 AirPods got minor updates, including voice isolation during phone calls, spatial audio during games, and nodding or shaking for responding to prompts.\\n\\n06:25 Apple TV updates include showing actors' and characters' names on screen and boosting people's voices over the music.\\n\\niPad OS Updates 📊\\n06:41 iPad OS allows remote control of someone's iPad with their permission, perfect for family tech support.\\n\\n07:03 The calculator app on iPad OS is impressive, letting you write equations in handwriting and getting real-time answers.\\n\\nMac OS Updates 📊\\n09:40 Mac OS got a new version called Sequoia, featuring automatic window snapping, built-in backgrounds for webcam feeds, and a new password app.\\n\\nApple Intelligence AI 🤖\\n10:40 Apple rebranded AI as Apple Intelligence, bringing new generative models and large language models to supported devices.\\n\\n11:01 Apple Intelligence features include writing tools, a cleanup tool in Photos, and generative emojis.\\n\\nHow Apple Handles Complex AI Tasks 💻\\n15:10 Apple handles most AI tasks on-device, using Apple-built models for faster processing. However, for complex tasks, Apple has two alternative approaches.\\n\\n15:32 One approach uses a larger server-based model on Apple's Private Cloud compute, ensuring data is not stored or sent to Apple, but may have downsides like slower processing and internet dependence.\\n\\n15:54 The other approach asks the user for permission to use ChatGPT, allowing access to its capabilities and generating more realistic and varied images.\\n\\nPrivacy and Security of AI Features 🔒\\n16:18 Apple ensures privacy and security by not storing requests, obscuring IP addresses, and preventing OpenAI from forming a profile.

       "0    [I don’t give a shit about “Apple Intelligence” since it’s only supported for 15 Pro and above. I’m sure as shit not buying a new iPhone for this and I’m not even sure if I’m going to buy another ever. The home screen customisation and iMessage features are pretty good to being ios on par with Android. What bothers me is that people just want simple stuff from their phones. The option to put icons anywhere, a button to close all open apps, option to customise control center, etc. It’s good that Apple is finally addressing all this. From all the AI features I saw, nothing really made me go “oh this is a game changer”. I think phone operating systems have peaked., Safari don’t load websites very annoying but with chrome straight away, every year people expecting multitasking capabilities and split screen features but never came out,again Android phones have it for years, basically iPhone is trying to coping Android features that they have for years like for example widgets home screen but they do it so poorly not even close…By the way color change icons is a joke is another desperate way to allow the iPhone user to do something on icons when you have it for years a possibility the chance to change the entire icons design on Android phones. Basically what they are doing is put ther phones with the same features but take ages for a consumer get does features on iPhone that’s why people move to Android. People tired to wait years for developments, basically Apple software customization and  innovation departments in the last 10 years don’teven close what Android phones offer, even a Android phone released 10 years ago the software is more advanced compared to a brand new iPhone. All this years im still thinking IPhone can have the advanced software that Android phones have it, but Apple is doing this transition very slow so that away not being very noticeable. To be honest every person that have both phones straight away agree with me, basically if you only use Android phone you don’t understand that your phone Operating System is so blast advanced.\\nOn the other hand a person that uses only IPhone don’t understand how basic the IOS iPhone operating system it is compared to Android Operating system software looks like living in a stone age, honestly just to put you in perspective when you use Android phone feels like the Android phone user is already in 2035 at least . But don’t forget when you buy a Android phone don’t buy the cheapest one because you need at least a medium performance processor so you good on average price don’t need to be a top line or a flagship Android phone but if you can affordit better., Summarized by AskTube\\n\\nWWDC Keynote Highlights 📱\\n00:02 Apple's WWDC keynote was filled with exciting announcements, including a surprise introduction to AI in the second half.\\n\\n00:25 The author live-tweeted the event and summarizes all the key announcements and thoughts.\\n\\nVision OS 2.0 📊\\n00:47 Vision OS 2.0 brings new features like wrist-turn gestures to see time and battery percentage, and quick access to the control center.\\n\\n01:05 New Immersive Media Features: Turn old photos into spatial photos using advanced machine learning, and create spatial videos on non-iPhone cameras.\\n\\niOS Updates 📱\\n02:29 iOS got a major update with customizable home screens, icon placement, and a new theme engine.\\n\\n02:54 Customize your home screen with different colors, and change icon and widget colors to match your wallpaper.\\n\\nOther Updates 📊\\n03:37 Mac mirroring gets a higher resolution, and new tools are available for creating spatial and immersive videos.\\n\\n04:00 New features include scheduling text messages, text formatting, a game mode that minimizes background activity, and automatic categorization in the new mail app.\\n\\nAirPods and Apple TV Updates 🎧\\n06:05 AirPods got minor updates, including voice isolation during phone calls, spatial audio during games, and nodding or shaking for responding to prompts.\\n\\n06:25 Apple TV updates include showing actors' and characters' names on screen and boosting people's voices over the music.\\n\\niPad OS Updates 📊\\n06:41 iPad OS allows remote control of someone's iPad with their permission, perfect for family tech support.\\n\\n07:03 The calculator app on iPad OS is impressive, letting you write equations in handwriting and getting real-time answers.\\n\\nMac OS Updates 📊\\n09:40 Mac OS got a new version called Sequoia, featuring automatic window snapping, built-in backgrounds for webcam feeds, and a new password app.\\n\\nApple Intelligence AI 🤖\\n10:40 Apple rebranded AI as Apple Intelligence, bringing new generative models and large language models to supported devices.\\n\\n11:01 Apple Intelligence features include writing tools, a cleanup tool in Photos, and generative emojis.\\n\\nHow Apple Handles Complex AI Tasks 💻\\n15:10 Apple handles most AI tasks on-device, using Apple-built models for faster processing.

I bought an SSD for $20 and loaded it with Linux.  I suppose some people really need the \"latest and greatest\".  But I don't.  In about 16 months the \"used computer\" market will be FLOODED because Windows 10 will no longer be supported and Windows 11 needs new hardware.  It's a great time to buy used tech., well done Apple!, Apple ... what ?]  \n",

If it runs most of the AI stuff on device and the personal cloud computing really does what Apple says, like not storing any data, being totally encrypted etc and IF WE CAN IMPROVE THE AI IN OUR PHONE using our own data without sending it back to any server then it's huge, like massive. \\n\\n2. The new icons especially the tinted one sucks, overall I feel the UI does give more freedom but it doesn't look that good, it comes nowhere near material design.\\n\\n3. This is probably the biggest iOS update in a long time if Apple can make Siri more powerful, or powerful enough that we don't need to do anything in chatGpt at all then I can really see a reason to go for pro models, \"As you can see, all the same iPhones running iOS 17 can be updated to iOS 18. However, there’s a catch. According to Apple, only the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are compatible with the new AI, or Apple Intelligence, features. This is because these features require the A17 Pro or M1 chip or later.\"\\n\\n  \\nI have an 11 Pro Max. Does this mean Siri won't work?, I ditched iPhone a couple years ago to use Samsung because I use Windows PC's and don't like MacOS. But I still like to watch videos like these to keep up with what they're doing. Very cool what they are doing. I can't believe it took them until 2024 to allow people to customize icons on the home screen, though. Btw, I like how Marques reads his list off his Ultra phone. Samsung phones really are great. Can you multitask yet on an iPhone or is it still one app at a time kind of thing? Vision Pro looks really cool. I might be enticed to come back to Apple.]</td>\n",

Also..... how in 2024 do we not have a GD MF'N NUMBER ROW??? I'm over this shit. I have to use Swiftkey because it's that important of a keyboard feature for me. \\n\\nThe home screen customization is welcomed, but the icon hue slider is going to create some ugly home screens. All of this new customization they're giving us and they don't do anything with icon packs? That would have been great. One neat thing I noticed is the ability to remove icon app names, but they way it's implemented isn't very Apple Intelligent. The icons are expanded in size, removing the app names. It would have been much better to just give us a toggle. I don't want larger icons. I'm still going to stick with my custom icons that I don't give a name to., You couldn't move around the icons on the home screen on iPhone until 2024?]</td>\n",

If it runs most of the AI stuff on device and the personal cloud computing really does what Apple says, like not storing any data, being totally encrypted etc and IF WE CAN IMPROVE THE AI IN OUR PHONE using our own data without sending it back to any server then it's huge, like massive. \\n\\n2. The new icons especially the tinted one sucks, overall I feel the UI does give more freedom but it doesn't look that good, it comes nowhere near material design.\\n\\n3. This is probably the biggest iOS update in a long time if Apple can make Siri more powerful, or powerful enough that we don't need to do anything in chatGpt at all then I can really see a reason to go for pro models, \"As you can see, all the same iPhones running iOS 17 can be updated to iOS 18. However, there’s a catch. According to Apple, only the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are compatible with the new AI, or Apple Intelligence, features. This is because these features require the A17 Pro or M1 chip or later.\"\\n\\n  \\nI have an 11 Pro Max. Does this mean Siri won't work?, I ditched iPhone a couple years ago to use Samsung because I use Windows PC's and don't like MacOS. But I still like to watch videos like these to keep up with what they're doing. Very cool what they are doing. I can't believe it took them until 2024 to allow people to customize icons on the home screen, though. Btw, I like how Marques reads his list off his Ultra phone. Samsung phones really are great. Can you multitask yet on an iPhone or is it still one app at a time kind of thing? Vision Pro looks really cool. I might be enticed to come back to Apple.]  \n",

People would go crazy if you could have iOS 6 icons on your homescreen., Man. I'm excited about AI baked into iOS for sure.  I was hoping to see them talk about iOS keyboard improvements tho. Hopefully ChatGPT is used to make their swipe text prediction better, because it's absolutely horrible. Also..... how in 2024 do we not have a GD MF'N NUMBER ROW??? I'm over this shit. I have to use Swiftkey because it's that important of a keyboard feature for me. \\n\\nThe home screen customization is welcomed, but the icon hue slider is going to create some ugly home screens. All of this new customization they're giving us and they don't do anything with icon packs? That would have been great. One neat thing I noticed is the ability to remove icon app names, but they way it's implemented isn't very Apple Intelligent. The icons are expanded in size, removing the app names. It would have been much better to just give us a toggle. I don't want larger icons. I'm still going to stick with my custom icons that I don't give a name to., You couldn't move around the icons on the home screen on iPhone until 2024?]  \n",

I know they are saying all m chip Mac’s will get apple intelligence but do you think the older models (m3-m1) will be limited in someway., truly gutted, last years WWDC saw the Mac Studio get a chip upgrade, and earlier this year i ultimately got to a point where i could no longer work because simply viewing a photo caused my MacBook's (2018 pro) fans to spin up - and it runs hot !\\n\\nbut, i've waited it out for months in hopes of the upgrade to come, and my patience did not pay off\\n\\nto go from a 2018 intel MacBook Pro to an M2 Max Mac Studio is gonna be a hell of an upgrade\\n - but imagine leapfrogging the first two, maybe even three generation M chips to land on an M3/M4 Max\\n\\nyet somehow, whilst iPad 'what is a computer' nerds can pick up an M4 chip for no more than a thousand dollars; these pro machines are undeniably left behind on M2 for the time being 🙄 makes total sense.]  \n",

       "      <td>My take on WWDC's iPad calculator app: It's nothing more than a gimmick WWDC just dropped yesterday and one of the highlight features was the calculator app feature. MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world. Ok, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks: It’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. You can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly. It can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want. You can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers. The features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools? The first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  In this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. Anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire   That calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad. The second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? Finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. You don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. This reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). It’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. Other examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I will never understand these chucklefucks trying to sell VR as a productivity tool at this stage in its development. Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face. ==================================== My requirements for a phone are actually quite simple:  -a camera with acceptable image quality -no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display -stereo front-facing speakers -a headphone jack as backup for when I need it -expandable storage for when I need it -the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS Thus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone. ==================================== Okay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see. ==================================== I honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet. ==================================== I'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.</td>\n",

How Apple Handles Complex AI Tasks 💻 15:10 Apple handles most AI tasks on-device, using Apple-built models for faster processing. However, for complex tasks, Apple has two alternative approaches. 15:32 One approach uses a larger server-based model on Apple's Private Cloud compute, ensuring data is not stored or sent to Apple, but may have downsides like slower processing and internet dependence. 15:54 The other approach asks the user for permission to use ChatGPT, allowing access to its capabilities and generating more realistic and varied images. Privacy and Security of AI Features 🔒 16:18 Apple ensures privacy and security by not storing requests, obscuring IP addresses, and preventing OpenAI from forming a profile. All this is done without an account and for free. Insights on Apple's AI Announcements 🤔 17:01 The author believes Apple's AI features are superior, with personalization and existing user info making them more effective. 17:25 The AI announcements overshadow other features, marking a new age for Apple, and the author is excited to explore its capabilities and what it can bring to users.

       "      <td>My takeaway was that across MacOS, iOS and iPadOS I found very few things that I could tell I would include in my daily use. I already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions.  I could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter! I just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro.  This came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\" I already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup.  Apple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels. Softwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works. So, I'm out, except for Mac.</td>\n",

       "      <td>**Lots** of great updates. There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance: 1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri. 2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap. 3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat. 4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.   5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.) 6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.) I get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.</td>\n",

We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 \"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\". Romans 10:13 states \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\". \\r \\r    Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.</td>\n",

They could’ve done this back in iOS 14 at once, there’s no reason to take 4 years to incorporate all these features. Summarization was already available on Mac, I’ve sent numerous feature requests, asking them to bring it system-wide to iPads and iPhones. This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray. I predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that.  The only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”.  This isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability.  Last time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected.  Furthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac.  - why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing?  Another thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got: - better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago) - Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind.  A few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I want to thank you for always giving us a well thought videos. Others spend time babbling and trying to be funny and you sound like a tech guy giving us tech news. I have a suggestion to take you to a new level. I have been writing Apple for years. I honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. I’ll share them in a moment. By the way I am a software engineer. I am not one who thinks I am so D smart or the smarted person in the room. I love to always learn and ai find I am always learning new things from you. So my idea for you is a real tech news Channel. This will make you something like the Wal Mart of tech news. This idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. I tried to float this to Apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. We have CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iPhone is released. Tech news is happening every day all day. I say join forces with some of the best like yourself, Brian Tong, possibly some from Engadget and create a real Tech News channel. It’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. EVs and Republicans wanting to K EVs, TicTok, Twitter. With social media companies being as influential as they have become. They’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. A real tech news channel will do this. What you and others do is journalism. I want the news to still be fun but I want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a CNN. You will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech CEO’s. It’s a militia billion. Dollar idea I am giving to you. This is something new of its kind and needed. Tech is no longer just mobile. We have stepped into the world of AI and Humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will I pack them. I would love to work with you as a producer or something. I have a huge idea and it will work.</td>\n",

       "1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               My take on WWDC's iPad calculator app: It's nothing more than a gimmick WWDC just dropped yesterday and one of the highlight features was the calculator app feature. MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world. Ok, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks: It’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. You can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly. It can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want. You can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers. The features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools? The first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  In this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. Anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire   That calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad. The second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? Finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. You don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. This reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). It’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. Other examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.  \n",

Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face. ==================================== My requirements for a phone are actually quite simple:  -a camera with acceptable image quality -no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display -stereo front-facing speakers -a headphone jack as backup for when I need it -expandable storage for when I need it -the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS Thus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone. ==================================== Okay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see. ==================================== I honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet. ==================================== I'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.  \n",

How Apple Handles Complex AI Tasks 💻 15:10 Apple handles most AI tasks on-device, using Apple-built models for faster processing. However, for complex tasks, Apple has two alternative approaches. 15:32 One approach uses a larger server-based model on Apple's Private Cloud compute, ensuring data is not stored or sent to Apple, but may have downsides like slower processing and internet dependence. 15:54 The other approach asks the user for permission to use ChatGPT, allowing access to its capabilities and generating more realistic and varied images. Privacy and Security of AI Features 🔒 16:18 Apple ensures privacy and security by not storing requests, obscuring IP addresses, and preventing OpenAI from forming a profile. All this is done without an account and for free.

I already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions.  I could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter! I just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro.  This came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\" I already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup.  Apple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels. Softwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works. So, I'm out, except for Mac.  \n",

There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance: 1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri. 2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap. 3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat. 4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.   5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.) 6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.) I get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.  \n",

We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 \"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\". Romans 10:13 states \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\". \\r \\r    Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.  \n",

                                                           Not only that, for most of the presentation they did say that iphone would have apple intelligence and in the end they said only iphone 15 pro models, is like... 😂 okay apple, not all people can afford a 1100 and 1300 dollars usd smartphones, thanks, steve jobs said that apple is for the humanity and to give them technology to improve people's lifes, apple had vision, tim cook did it until 2018, then everything has go slowly downhill, not all of it of course, but very down, not only that, but jobs said that according to our efforts we decide the price of our products, we try the most to price it correctly, well that was in 2009, and for your knowledge, apple intelligence is only available for 2 iphones (of more than 24 iphones eligible for the ios 18 update *oh is because they don't have 6gb of ram, well darling the Android phone of my Granny costs 200 dollars and has 8gb of ddr4 ram and on screen ai analysis to summarize websites with Gemini for free -well you exchange your data even when they say no but i don't believe any company in terms of 100% privacy so it's meh for me, is logic, that's why USA gov wants to ban TikTok cuz they don't have control over their info and the excuse is that they are \"spies\"-, apple does not use a \"unique physical ram\" to justify their price, like i say.. thefts*) but hey you have good animations :D and \"the ecosystem\" that windows and android are reaching more fast than ever to the point of apple, apple= no moral and respectful for people's money and time (so contrary to Steve's apple), yeah they have good and incredible things like the integration of apple intelligence offline but it doesn't help the fact that whenever they do something great they put it like god's new technology to justify prices in this times when they are not the unique smartphone company they were in 2007-2018, others are in the same level or little lower or little higher than them in terms of technology, i hope that the apple directive is changed but that will not happen because money runs the world and if they are still selling, nothing will change.  P.d. They said thar A17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really? They always said new processors of apple silicon are the most fastest in the world all the time, the processor of the iphone 14 pro max is slow? Gosh they are really inmoral capitalists (i agree with capitalism and liberal economies)  \n",

They could’ve done this back in iOS 14 at once, there’s no reason to take 4 years to incorporate all these features. Summarization was already available on Mac, I’ve sent numerous feature requests, asking them to bring it system-wide to iPads and iPhones. This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray. I predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that.  The only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”.  This isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability.  Last time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected.  Furthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac.  - why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing?  Another thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got: - better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago) - Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind.  A few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.  \n",

Others spend time babbling and trying to be funny and you sound like a tech guy giving us tech news. I have a suggestion to take you to a new level. I have been writing Apple for years. I honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. I’ll share them in a moment. By the way I am a software engineer. I am not one who thinks I am so D smart or the smarted person in the room. I love to always learn and ai find I am always learning new things from you. So my idea for you is a real tech news Channel. This will make you something like the Wal Mart of tech news. This idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. I tried to float this to Apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. We have CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iPhone is released. Tech news is happening every day all day. I say join forces with some of the best like yourself, Brian Tong, possibly some from Engadget and create a real Tech News channel. It’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. EVs and Republicans wanting to K EVs, TicTok, Twitter. With social media companies being as influential as they have become. They’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. A real tech news channel will do this. What you and others do is journalism. I want the news to still be fun but I want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a CNN. You will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech CEO’s. It’s a militia billion. Dollar idea I am giving to you. This is something new of its kind and needed. Tech is no longer just mobile. We have stepped into the world of AI and Humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will I pack them. I would love to work with you as a producer or something. I have a huge idea and it will work.  "

       "      <td>My take on WWDC's iPad calculator app: It's nothing more than a gimmick WWDC just dropped yesterday and one of the highlight features was the calculator app feature. MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world. Ok, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks: It’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. You can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly. It can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want. You can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers. The features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools? The first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  In this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. Anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire   That calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad. The second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? Finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. You don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. This reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). It’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. Other examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I will never understand these chucklefucks trying to sell VR as a productivity tool at this stage in its development. Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face. ==================================== My requirements for a phone are actually quite simple:  -a camera with acceptable image quality -no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display -stereo front-facing speakers -a headphone jack as backup for when I need it -expandable storage for when I need it -the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS Thus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone. ==================================== Okay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see. ==================================== I honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet. ==================================== I'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Summarized by AskTube WWDC Keynote Highlights 📱 00:02 Apple's WWDC keynote was filled with exciting announcements, including a surprise introduction to AI in the second half. 00:25 The author live-tweeted the event and summarizes all the key announcements and thoughts. Vision OS 2.0 📊 00:47 Vision OS 2.0 brings new features like wrist-turn gestures to see time and battery percentage, and quick access to the control center. 01:05 New Immersive Media Features: Turn old photos into spatial photos using advanced machine learning, and create spatial videos on non-iPhone cameras. iOS Updates 📱 02:29 iOS got a major update with customizable home screens, icon placement, and a new theme engine. 02:54 Customize your home screen with different colors, and change icon and widget colors to match your wallpaper. Other Updates 📊 03:37 Mac mirroring gets a higher resolution, and new tools are available for creating spatial and immersive videos. 04:00 New features include scheduling text messages, text formatting, a game mode that minimizes background activity, and automatic categorization in the new mail app. AirPods and Apple TV Updates 🎧 06:05 AirPods got minor updates, including voice isolation during phone calls, spatial audio during games, and nodding or shaking for responding to prompts. 06:25 Apple TV updates include showing actors' and characters' names on screen and boosting people's voices over the music. iPad OS Updates 📊 06:41 iPad OS allows remote control of someone's iPad with their permission, perfect for family tech support. 07:03 The calculator app on iPad OS is impressive, letting you write equations in handwriting and getting real-time answers. Mac OS Updates 📊 09:40 Mac OS got a new version called Sequoia, featuring automatic window snapping, built-in backgrounds for webcam feeds, and a new password app. Apple Intelligence AI 🤖 10:40 Apple rebranded AI as Apple Intelligence, bringing new generative models and large language models to supported devices. 11:01 Apple Intelligence features include writing tools, a cleanup tool in Photos, and generative emojis. How Apple Handles Complex AI Tasks 💻 15:10 Apple handles most AI tasks on-device, using Apple-built models for faster processing. However, for complex tasks, Apple has two alternative approaches. 15:32 One approach uses a larger server-based model on Apple's Private Cloud compute, ensuring data is not stored or sent to Apple, but may have downsides like slower processing and internet dependence. 15:54 The other approach asks the user for permission to use ChatGPT, allowing access to its capabilities and generating more realistic and varied images. Privacy and Security of AI Features 🔒 16:18 Apple ensures privacy and security by not storing requests, obscuring IP addresses, and preventing OpenAI from forming a profile. All this is done without an account and for free. Insights on Apple's AI Announcements 🤔 17:01 The author believes Apple's AI features are superior, with personalization and existing user info making them more effective. 17:25 The AI announcements overshadow other features, marking a new age for Apple, and the author is excited to explore its capabilities and what it can bring to users.

       "      <td>My takeaway was that across MacOS, iOS and iPadOS I found very few things that I could tell I would include in my daily use. I already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions.  I could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter! I just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro.  This came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\" I already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup.  Apple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels. Softwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works. So, I'm out, except for Mac.</td>\n",

       "      <td>**Lots** of great updates. There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance: 1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri. 2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap. 3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat. 4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.   5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.) 6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.) I get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.</td>\n",

We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 \"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\". Romans 10:13 states \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\". \\r \\r    Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.</td>\n",

P.d. They said thar A17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really? They always said new processors of apple silicon are the most fastest in the world all the time, the processor of the iphone 14 pro max is slow?

       "      <td>My first impression is definitely that they’re playing catch-up, in terms of QoL features. They could’ve done this back in iOS 14 at once, there’s no reason to take 4 years to incorporate all these features. Summarization was already available on Mac, I’ve sent numerous feature requests, asking them to bring it system-wide to iPads and iPhones. This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray. I predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that.  The only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”.  This isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability.  Last time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected.  Furthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac.  - why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing?  Another thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got: - better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago) - Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind.  A few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.</td>\n",

I have a suggestion to take you to a new level. I have been writing Apple for years. I honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. I’ll share them in a moment. By the way I am a software engineer. I am not one who thinks I am so D smart or the smarted person in the room. I love to always learn and ai find I am always learning new things from you. So my idea for you is a real tech news Channel. This will make you something like the Wal Mart of tech news. This idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. I tried to float this to Apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. We have CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iPhone is released. Tech news is happening every day all day. I say join forces with some of the best like yourself, Brian Tong, possibly some from Engadget and create a real Tech News channel. It’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. EVs and Republicans wanting to K EVs, TicTok, Twitter. With social media companies being as influential as they have become. They’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. A real tech news channel will do this. What you and others do is journalism. I want the news to still be fun but I want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a CNN. You will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech CEO’s. It’s a militia billion. Dollar idea I am giving to you. This is something new of its kind and needed. Tech is no longer just mobile. We have stepped into the world of AI and Humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will I pack them. I would love to work with you as a producer or something. I have a huge idea and it will work.</td>\n",

       "1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               My take on WWDC's iPad calculator app: It's nothing more than a gimmick WWDC just dropped yesterday and one of the highlight features was the calculator app feature. MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world. Ok, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks: It’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. You can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly. It can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want. You can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers. The features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools? The first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  In this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. Anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire   That calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad. The second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? Finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. You don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. This reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). It’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. Other examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.   \n",

Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face. ==================================== My requirements for a phone are actually quite simple:  -a camera with acceptable image quality -no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display -stereo front-facing speakers -a headphone jack as backup for when I need it -expandable storage for when I need it -the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS Thus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone. ==================================== Okay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see. ==================================== I honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet. ==================================== I'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.   \n",

How Apple Handles Complex AI Tasks 💻 15:10 Apple handles most AI tasks on-device, using Apple-built models for faster processing. However, for complex tasks, Apple has two alternative approaches. 15:32 One approach uses a larger server-based model on Apple's Private Cloud compute, ensuring data is not stored or sent to Apple, but may have downsides like slower processing and internet dependence. 15:54 The other approach asks the user for permission to use ChatGPT, allowing access to its capabilities and generating more realistic and varied images. Privacy and Security of AI Features 🔒 16:18 Apple ensures privacy and security by not storing requests, obscuring IP addresses, and preventing OpenAI from forming a profile. All this is done without an account and for free.

I already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions.  I could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter! I just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro.  This came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\" I already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup.  Apple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels. Softwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works. So, I'm out, except for Mac.   \n",

There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance: 1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri. 2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap. 3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat. 4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.   5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.) 6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.) I get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.   \n",

We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 \"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\". Romans 10:13 states \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\". \\r \\r    Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.   \n",

                                                           Not only that, for most of the presentation they did say that iphone would have apple intelligence and in the end they said only iphone 15 pro models, is like... 😂 okay apple, not all people can afford a 1100 and 1300 dollars usd smartphones, thanks, steve jobs said that apple is for the humanity and to give them technology to improve people's lifes, apple had vision, tim cook did it until 2018, then everything has go slowly downhill, not all of it of course, but very down, not only that, but jobs said that according to our efforts we decide the price of our products, we try the most to price it correctly, well that was in 2009, and for your knowledge, apple intelligence is only available for 2 iphones (of more than 24 iphones eligible for the ios 18 update *oh is because they don't have 6gb of ram, well darling the Android phone of my Granny costs 200 dollars and has 8gb of ddr4 ram and on screen ai analysis to summarize websites with Gemini for free -well you exchange your data even when they say no but i don't believe any company in terms of 100% privacy so it's meh for me, is logic, that's why USA gov wants to ban TikTok cuz they don't have control over their info and the excuse is that they are \"spies\"-, apple does not use a \"unique physical ram\" to justify their price, like i say.. thefts*) but hey you have good animations :D and \"the ecosystem\" that windows and android are reaching more fast than ever to the point of apple, apple= no moral and respectful for people's money and time (so contrary to Steve's apple), yeah they have good and incredible things like the integration of apple intelligence offline but it doesn't help the fact that whenever they do something great they put it like god's new technology to justify prices in this times when they are not the unique smartphone company they were in 2007-2018, others are in the same level or little lower or little higher than them in terms of technology, i hope that the apple directive is changed but that will not happen because money runs the world and if they are still selling, nothing will change.  P.d. They said thar A17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really? They always said new processors of apple silicon are the most fastest in the world all the time, the processor of the iphone 14 pro max is slow? Gosh they are really inmoral capitalists (i agree with capitalism and liberal economies)   \n",

They could’ve done this back in iOS 14 at once, there’s no reason to take 4 years to incorporate all these features. Summarization was already available on Mac, I’ve sent numerous feature requests, asking them to bring it system-wide to iPads and iPhones. This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray. I predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that.  The only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”.  This isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability.  Last time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected.  Furthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac.  - why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing?  Another thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got: - better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago) - Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind.  A few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.   \n",

Others spend time babbling and trying to be funny and you sound like a tech guy giving us tech news. I have a suggestion to take you to a new level. I have been writing Apple for years. I honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. I’ll share them in a moment. By the way I am a software engineer. I am not one who thinks I am so D smart or the smarted person in the room. I love to always learn and ai find I am always learning new things from you. So my idea for you is a real tech news Channel. This will make you something like the Wal Mart of tech news. This idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. I tried to float this to Apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. We have CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iPhone is released. Tech news is happening every day all day. I say join forces with some of the best like yourself, Brian Tong, possibly some from Engadget and create a real Tech News channel. It’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. EVs and Republicans wanting to K EVs, TicTok, Twitter. With social media companies being as influential as they have become. They’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. A real tech news channel will do this. What you and others do is journalism. I want the news to still be fun but I want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a CNN. You will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech CEO’s. It’s a militia billion. Dollar idea I am giving to you. This is something new of its kind and needed. Tech is no longer just mobile. We have stepped into the world of AI and Humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will I pack them. I would love to work with you as a producer or something. I have a huge idea and it will work.   \n",

       "\"My take on WWDC's iPad calculator app: It's nothing more than a gimmick WWDC just dropped yesterday and one of the highlight features was the calculator app feature. MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world. Ok, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks: It’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. You can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly. It can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want. You can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers. The features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools? The first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  In this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. Anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire   That calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad. The second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? Finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. You don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. This reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). It’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. Other examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.\""

Ok, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks: It’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. You can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly. It can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want. You can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers. The features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools? The first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  In this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. Anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire   That calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad. The second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? Finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. You don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. This reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). It’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. Other examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.</td>\n",

P.d. They said thar A17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really? They always said new processors of apple silicon are the most fastest in the world all the time, the processor of the iphone 14 pro max is slow?

       "      <td>Apple's presentation misled people by saying iPhone would have Apple Intelligence, only to reveal that it's limited to iPhone 15 Pro models. This exclusivity is frustrating, especially considering the high prices, up to $1300. Steve Jobs' vision for Apple was to make technology accessible to humanity, but under Tim Cook's leadership, prices have increased and the company's priorities have shifted. Apple claims to price their products fairly, but this is contradictory to the experience of many customers. The availability of Apple Intelligence is limited to only two iPhone models, when some Android phones costing as little as $200 have similar features. Apple's use of unique physical RAM is not justified by their prices. The company's focus on animations and ecosystem is not enough to compensate for their lack of moral and respectful treatment of customers' money and time. The integration of Apple Intelligence offline is impressive, but it doesn't excuse the company's behavior. Apple claims the A17 Pro chipset is necessary for Apple Intelligence, but this contradicts their previous claims that their processors are the fastest in the world. Ultimately, I hope Apple's approach will change, but I fear that greed and profits will drive their decisions.</td>\n",

I have a suggestion to take you to a new level. I have been writing Apple for years. I honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. I’ll share them in a moment. By the way I am a software engineer. I am not one who thinks I am so D smart or the smarted person in the room. I love to always learn and ai find I am always learning new things from you. So my idea for you is a real tech news Channel. This will make you something like the Wal Mart of tech news. This idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. I tried to float this to Apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. We have CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iPhone is released. Tech news is happening every day all day. I say join forces with some of the best like yourself, Brian Tong, possibly some from Engadget and create a real Tech News channel. It’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. EVs and Republicans wanting to K EVs, TicTok, Twitter. With social media companies being as influential as they have become. They’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. A real tech news channel will do this. What you and others do is journalism. I want the news to still be fun but I want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a CNN. You will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech CEO’s. It’s a militia billion. Dollar idea I am giving to you. This is something new of its kind and needed. Tech is no longer just mobile. We have stepped into the world of AI and Humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will I pack them. I would love to work with you as a producer or something. I have a huge idea and it will work.</td>\n",

I believe this idea could make you a prominent figure in the tech industry, even rivaling the likes of Brian Tong and Engadget. The tech industry is constantly evolving, with new and innovative products being released daily.

       "      <td>I will never understand these chucklefucks trying to sell VR as a productivity tool at this stage in its development. Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face. ==================================== My requirements for a phone are actually quite simple:  -a camera with acceptable image quality -no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display -stereo front-facing speakers -a headphone jack as backup for when I need it -expandable storage for when I need it -the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS Thus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone. ==================================== Okay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see. ==================================== I honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet. ==================================== I'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.</td>\n",

       "      <td>My first impression is definitely that they’re playing catch-up, in terms of QoL features. They could’ve done this back in iOS 14 at once, there’s no reason to take 4 years to incorporate all these features. Summarization was already available on Mac, I’ve sent numerous feature requests, asking them to bring it system-wide to iPads and iPhones. This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray. I predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that.  The only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”.  This isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability.  Last time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected.  Furthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac.  - why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing?  Another thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got: - better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago) - Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind.  A few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.</td>\n",

The iPad, in particular, has become more buggy and neglected. I'm skeptical about the value of the iPad Pro, which can't match the capabilities of the Mac or iPhone. Features like app organization and window management, which are now available on Mac, should have come to the iPad sooner.

I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri. 2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap. 3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat. 4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.   5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.) 6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.) I get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.</td>\n",
       "      <td>I'm excited about the latest updates, but there are a few things that didn't quite sit well with me at first glance. The generative features feel like they're overkill, and I prefer Apple's Siri over Microsoft's. The color-tinted icons remind me of cheap icon packs from years ago, and I'm not a fan of Apple's password solution. I use Bitwarden, so I hope they don't push their solution on me.\\n\\nI'm surprised by the blatant ChatGPT branding in the user experience, as it feels un-Apple like. On the other hand, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS, and I appreciate the improved search functionality. However, I'm not a fan of Stage Manager, and I hope I can continue to use my preferred shortcuts.\\n\\nI also think it's ironic that the Settings app is complicated enough that Apple is using AI to navigate through it. As a Software Engineer and consumer, I'm always uncomfortable with feature bloat. Despite this, I'm looking forward to getting my hands on this release and exploring the new features.</td>\n",

       "      <td>My takeaway was that across MacOS, iOS and iPadOS I found very few things that I could tell I would include in my daily use. I already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions.  I could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter! I just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro.  This came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\" I already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup.  Apple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels. Softwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works. So, I'm out, except for Mac.</td>\n",
       "      <td>I was underwhelmed by the latest Apple announcements, finding few features that excited me. I already use 1Password, so Apple Passwords was unnecessary. I also found similar functionality with BetterTouchTool's snap functions. What I really miss is improved virtual desktop handling on Mac, which I use daily. I traded in my 2017 iPad Pro for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+, getting most of the new features at a lower cost. The S9+ has a 16:10 format, which is not ideal, but it's more compact than the old iPad Pro. I may have moved away from iOS, but I still use Apple for my Mac. However, the latest announcements didn't give me any reason to switch back from Samsung. The Galaxy Fold 4, for example, has features I love, like its foldable design. Apple's dilemma is that they make great hardware, but few reasons to upgrade. I could easily use an iPhone XS and not notice a difference. Software-wise, Samsung's OneUI allows me to customize features to my liking, which is more appealing than Apple's approach.</td>\n",

We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 \"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\". Romans 10:13 states \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\". \\r \\r    Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.   \n",

MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world. Ok, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks: It’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. You can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly. It can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want. You can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers. The features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools? The first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  In this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. Anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire   That calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad. The second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? Finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. You don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. This reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). It’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. Other examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.   \n",

                                                           Not only that, for most of the presentation they did say that iphone would have apple intelligence and in the end they said only iphone 15 pro models, is like... 😂 okay apple, not all people can afford a 1100 and 1300 dollars usd smartphones, thanks, steve jobs said that apple is for the humanity and to give them technology to improve people's lifes, apple had vision, tim cook did it until 2018, then everything has go slowly downhill, not all of it of course, but very down, not only that, but jobs said that according to our efforts we decide the price of our products, we try the most to price it correctly, well that was in 2009, and for your knowledge, apple intelligence is only available for 2 iphones (of more than 24 iphones eligible for the ios 18 update *oh is because they don't have 6gb of ram, well darling the Android phone of my Granny costs 200 dollars and has 8gb of ddr4 ram and on screen ai analysis to summarize websites with Gemini for free -well you exchange your data even when they say no but i don't believe any company in terms of 100% privacy so it's meh for me, is logic, that's why USA gov wants to ban TikTok cuz they don't have control over their info and the excuse is that they are \"spies\"-, apple does not use a \"unique physical ram\" to justify their price, like i say.. thefts*) but hey you have good animations :D and \"the ecosystem\" that windows and android are reaching more fast than ever to the point of apple, apple= no moral and respectful for people's money and time (so contrary to Steve's apple), yeah they have good and incredible things like the integration of apple intelligence offline but it doesn't help the fact that whenever they do something great they put it like god's new technology to justify prices in this times when they are not the unique smartphone company they were in 2007-2018, others are in the same level or little lower or little higher than them in terms of technology, i hope that the apple directive is changed but that will not happen because money runs the world and if they are still selling, nothing will change.  P.d. They said thar A17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really? They always said new processors of apple silicon are the most fastest in the world all the time, the processor of the iphone 14 pro max is slow? Gosh they are really inmoral capitalists (i agree with capitalism and liberal economies)   \n",

Others spend time babbling and trying to be funny and you sound like a tech guy giving us tech news. I have a suggestion to take you to a new level. I have been writing Apple for years. I honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. I’ll share them in a moment. By the way I am a software engineer. I am not one who thinks I am so D smart or the smarted person in the room. I love to always learn and ai find I am always learning new things from you. So my idea for you is a real tech news Channel. This will make you something like the Wal Mart of tech news. This idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. I tried to float this to Apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. We have CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iPhone is released. Tech news is happening every day all day. I say join forces with some of the best like yourself, Brian Tong, possibly some from Engadget and create a real Tech News channel. It’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. EVs and Republicans wanting to K EVs, TicTok, Twitter. With social media companies being as influential as they have become. They’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. A real tech news channel will do this. What you and others do is journalism. I want the news to still be fun but I want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a CNN. You will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech CEO’s. It’s a militia billion. Dollar idea I am giving to you. This is something new of its kind and needed. Tech is no longer just mobile. We have stepped into the world of AI and Humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will I pack them. I would love to work with you as a producer or something. I have a huge idea and it will work.   \n",

Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face. ==================================== My requirements for a phone are actually quite simple:  -a camera with acceptable image quality -no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display -stereo front-facing speakers -a headphone jack as backup for when I need it -expandable storage for when I need it -the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS Thus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone. ==================================== Okay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see. ==================================== I honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet. ==================================== I'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.   \n",

They could’ve done this back in iOS 14 at once, there’s no reason to take 4 years to incorporate all these features. Summarization was already available on Mac, I’ve sent numerous feature requests, asking them to bring it system-wide to iPads and iPhones. This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray. I predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that.  The only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”.  This isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability.  Last time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected.  Furthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac.  - why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing?  Another thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got: - better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago) - Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind.  A few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.   \n",

There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance: 1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri. 2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap. 3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat. 4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.   5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.) 6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.) I get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.   \n",

I already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions.  I could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter! I just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro.  This came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\" I already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup.  Apple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels. Softwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works. So, I'm out, except for Mac.   \n",

He showed life after death and everlasting life through his sacrifice.\\n\\nTo gain eternal life in Heaven, all you have to do is believe that Jesus died for your sins and rose from the dead. Just ask Jesus to save you and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God.\\n\\nI'm sharing this message because I want to reach people and get them to think about salvation and life after death. Satan wants to distract us and keep us from seeking eternal life in Heaven. Please don't wait - ask Jesus to save you from your sins and give you a place in Heaven.  \n",

MKBHD called it the only \"incredible feature\" from WWDC, but it's hardly used in real-world scenarios. The app can give answers as you write down a math question, adjust variables, and add graphs. However, these features are useless beyond 4th grade, as more complex math requires mental arithmetic and showing working out.\\n\\nA physical calculator is better for exams, as it's faster, easier, and representative of actual exam conditions. The iPad calculator app is inferior and can be replaced by a $200 physical calculator like the TI-Nspire. The app's features are impressive, but they're not practical or useful beyond primary school.\\n\\nFree software like Geogebra and Desmos offer more features and are just as good, if not better, than the iPad calculator. The physical calculator is just as good, if not better, for math work, and the iPad app is a complete gimmick. We need to stop blindly following hype and reflect on how features would be used in real-world scenarios. The chances are, they're pretty useless and easily replaceable with cheaper alternatives.  \n",

This exclusivity is frustrating, especially considering the high prices, up to $1300. Steve Jobs' vision for Apple was to make technology accessible to humanity, but under Tim Cook's leadership, prices have increased and the company's priorities have shifted. Apple claims to price their products fairly, but this is contradictory to the experience of many customers. The availability of Apple Intelligence is limited to only two iPhone models, when some Android phones costing as little as $200 have similar features. Apple's use of unique physical RAM is not justified by their prices. The company's focus on animations and ecosystem is not enough to compensate for their lack of moral and respectful treatment of customers' money and time. The integration of Apple Intelligence offline is impressive, but it doesn't excuse the company's behavior. Apple claims the A17 Pro chipset is necessary for Apple Intelligence, but this contradicts their previous claims that their processors are the fastest in the world. Ultimately, I hope Apple's approach will change, but I fear that greed and profits will drive their decisions.  \n",
       "3  The WWDC keynote was exciting, with AI playing a major role. Vision OS 2.0 introduces new features like wrist-turn gestures and quick access to the control center. iOS got a major update with customizable home screens and a new theme engine. Mac mirroring resolution was improved, and new tools are available for creating spatial and immersive videos. Other updates include scheduling text messages, text formatting, and automatic categorization in the mail app.\\n\\nAirPods got minor updates, including voice isolation and spatial audio. Apple TV updates include showing actor names on screen and boosting voices over music. iPad OS allows remote control of someone's iPad and has an impressive calculator app. Mac OS got a new version called Sequoia, featuring automatic window snapping and a new password app.\\n\\nApple rebranded AI as Apple Intelligence, bringing new generative models and large language models to supported devices. Apple handles most AI tasks on-device, using Apple-built models for faster processing. The company also has two alternative approaches for handling complex tasks. Apple ensures privacy and security by not storing requests and obscuring IP addresses.\\n\\nI believe Apple's AI features are superior due to personalization and existing user info. The AI announcements mark a new age for Apple, and I'm excited to explore its capabilities. I'll be creating more videos about Apple's AI features and encourage viewers to subscribe for updates.  \n",

As a software engineer, I value your expertise and enjoy learning from you. My suggestion is to create a dedicated tech news channel, similar to CNN or ABC News, but focused on tech. This channel could feature in-depth interviews with tech CEOs and news anchors. I believe this idea could make you a prominent figure in the tech industry, even rivaling the likes of Brian Tong and Engadget. The tech industry is constantly evolving, with new and innovative products being released daily. A dedicated tech news channel would provide a platform to cover these developments, keeping viewers informed and engaged. I've had my own ideas for tech products and companies, and I'm convinced that some of my concepts have been used by Apple. Unfortunately, my suggestion for a tech news channel was rejected by Apple. I believe your channel could be a game-changer, providing a daily dose of tech news and analysis. I'd love to be a part of it as a producer or contributor.  \n",

Currently, they're heavy and cumbersome, making them difficult to wear for extended periods.\\n\\nMy phone requirements are simple: good camera, no notch, stereo speakers, headphone jack, expandable storage, and a customizable home screen. Unfortunately, few devices meet these criteria, and the iPhone has never been one of them.\\n\\nI recently used the new calculator app on iPad OS 18, which is an impressive hands-on application of OCR and AI. However, it's not for me since my handwriting is poor.\\n\\nI'm unimpressed with AI features, as they often struggle with understanding the English language. Photo editing is a good use case, but even then, it relies on proper camera settings. I'd prefer AI to optimize shots and merge images like the Light camera.\\n\\nI'm disappointed Apple didn't announce updates to their TOTL Mac products, and I'm eager to know when the next generation of devices will be available.  \n",

Many of these features were already available on Mac, such as summarized notifications, which I had requested be brought to iPads and iPhones. Features like Tapback options and image generation were already available on other platforms like WhatsApp and Google Photos. This year's WWDC showed incremental updates with some original features like image and emoji generation, but these don't justify the high cost of the iPad Pro.\\n\\nI miss the days when Apple released feature-packed updates for MacOS X, but now we're stuck with incremental updates and increasing bugs. The iPad, in particular, has become more buggy and neglected. I'm skeptical about the value of the iPad Pro, which can't match the capabilities of the Mac or iPhone. Features like app organization and window management, which are now available on Mac, should have come to the iPad sooner. It's clear that Apple prioritizes iPhone features over iPad and Mac.  \n",

       "8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            I'm excited about the latest updates, but there are a few things that didn't quite sit well with me at first glance. The generative features feel like they're overkill, and I prefer Apple's Siri over Microsoft's. The color-tinted icons remind me of cheap icon packs from years ago, and I'm not a fan of Apple's password solution. I use Bitwarden, so I hope they don't push their solution on me.\\n\\nI'm surprised by the blatant ChatGPT branding in the user experience, as it feels un-Apple like. On the other hand, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS, and I appreciate the improved search functionality. However, I'm not a fan of Stage Manager, and I hope I can continue to use my preferred shortcuts.\\n\\nI also think it's ironic that the Settings app is complicated enough that Apple is using AI to navigate through it. As a Software Engineer and consumer, I'm always uncomfortable with feature bloat. Despite this, I'm looking forward to getting my hands on this release and exploring the new features.  \n",

I already use 1Password, so Apple Passwords was unnecessary. I also found similar functionality with BetterTouchTool's snap functions. What I really miss is improved virtual desktop handling on Mac, which I use daily. I traded in my 2017 iPad Pro for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+, getting most of the new features at a lower cost. The S9+ has a 16:10 format, which is not ideal, but it's more compact than the old iPad Pro. I may have moved away from iOS, but I still use Apple for my Mac. However, the latest announcements didn't give me any reason to switch back from Samsung. The Galaxy Fold 4, for example, has features I love, like its foldable design. Apple's dilemma is that they make great hardware, but few reasons to upgrade. I could easily use an iPhone XS and not notice a difference. Software-wise, Samsung's OneUI allows me to customize features to my liking, which is more appealing than Apple's approach.  "

We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 \"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\". Romans 10:13 states \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\". \\r\\n\\r\\n   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.</td>\n",

       "      <td>My take on WWDC's iPad calculator app: It's nothing more than a gimmick\\n\\nWWDC just dropped yesterday and one of the highlight features was the calculator app feature. MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world.\\n\\nOk, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks:\\n\\nIt’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question.\\n\\nYou can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly.\\n\\nIt can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want.\\n\\nYou can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers.\\n\\nThe features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools?\\n\\nThe first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic. \\n\\nIn this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer.\\n\\nAnything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire \\n\\n\\nThat calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad.\\n\\nThe second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons?\\n\\nFinally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all.\\n\\nYou don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype.\\n\\nThis reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing).\\n\\nIt’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives.\\n\\nOther examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.</td>\n",

They always said new processors of apple silicon are the most fastest in the world all the time, the processor of the iphone 14 pro max is slow?

       "      <td>Apple's presentation misled people by saying iPhone would have Apple Intelligence, only to reveal that it's limited to iPhone 15 Pro models. This exclusivity is frustrating, especially considering the high prices, up to $1300. Steve Jobs' vision for Apple was to make technology accessible to humanity, but under Tim Cook's leadership, prices have increased and the company's priorities have shifted. Apple claims to price their products fairly, but this is contradictory to the experience of many customers. The availability of Apple Intelligence is limited to only two iPhone models, when some Android phones costing as little as $200 have similar features. Apple's use of unique physical RAM is not justified by their prices. The company's focus on animations and ecosystem is not enough to compensate for their lack of moral and respectful treatment of customers' money and time. The integration of Apple Intelligence offline is impressive, but it doesn't excuse the company's behavior. Apple claims the A17 Pro chipset is necessary for Apple Intelligence, but this contradicts their previous claims that their processors are the fastest in the world. Ultimately, I hope Apple's approach will change, but I fear that greed and profits will drive their decisions.</td>\n",

I have a suggestion to take you to a new level. I have been writing Apple for years. I honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. I’ll share them in a moment. By the way I am a software engineer. I am not one who thinks I am so D smart or the smarted person in the room. I love to always learn and ai find I am always learning new things from you. So my idea for you is a real tech news Channel. This will make you something like the Wal Mart of tech news. This idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. I tried to float this to Apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. We have CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iPhone is released. Tech news is happening every day all day. I say join forces with some of the best like yourself, Brian Tong, possibly some from Engadget and create a real Tech News channel. It’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. EVs and Republicans wanting to K EVs, TicTok, Twitter. With social media companies being as influential as they have become. They’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. A real tech news channel will do this. What you and others do is journalism. I want the news to still be fun but I want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a CNN. You will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech CEO’s. It’s a militia billion. Dollar idea I am giving to you. This is something new of its kind and needed. Tech is no longer just mobile. We have stepped into the world of AI and Humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will I pack them. I would love to work with you as a producer or something. I have a huge idea and it will work.</td>\n",

I believe this idea could make you a prominent figure in the tech industry, even rivaling the likes of Brian Tong and Engadget. The tech industry is constantly evolving, with new and innovative products being released daily. A dedicated tech news channel would provide a platform to cover these developments, keeping viewers informed and engaged. I've had my own ideas for tech products and companies, and I'm convinced that some of my concepts have been used by Apple. Unfortunately, my suggestion for a tech news channel was rejected by Apple.

Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face.\\n====================================\\nMy requirements for a phone are actually quite simple: \\n-a camera with acceptable image quality\\n-no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display\\n-stereo front-facing speakers\\n-a headphone jack as backup for when I need it\\n-expandable storage for when I need it\\n-the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS\\n\\nThus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone.\\n====================================\\nOkay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see.\\n====================================\\nI honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet.\\n====================================\\nI'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.</td>\n",

Currently, they're heavy and cumbersome, making them difficult to wear for extended periods. My phone requirements are simple: good camera, no notch, stereo speakers, headphone jack, expandable storage, and a customizable home screen. Unfortunately, few devices meet these criteria, and the iPhone has never been one of them. I recently used the new calculator app on iPad OS 18, which is an impressive hands-on application of OCR and AI. However, it's not for me since my handwriting is poor. I'm unimpressed with AI features, as they often struggle with understanding the English language. Photo editing is a good use case, but even then, it relies on proper camera settings.

This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray.\\n\\nI predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that. \\n\\nThe only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”. \\n\\nThis isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability. \\nLast time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected. \\nFurthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac. \\n- why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing? \\nAnother thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got:\\n- better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago)\\n- Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind. \\n\\nA few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.</td>\n",

I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri.\\n2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap.\\n3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat.\\n4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.  \\n5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.)\\n6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.)\\n\\nI get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.</td>\n",

Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\"\\n\\nI already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup. \\n\\nApple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels.\\n\\nSoftwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works.\\n\\nSo, I'm out, except for Mac.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I was underwhelmed by the latest Apple announcements, finding few features that excited me. I already use 1Password, so Apple Passwords was unnecessary. I also found similar functionality with BetterTouchTool's snap functions. What I really miss is improved virtual desktop handling on Mac, which I use daily. I traded in my 2017 iPad Pro for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+, getting most of the new features at a lower cost. The S9+ has a 16:10 format, which is not ideal, but it's more compact than the old iPad Pro. I may have moved away from iOS, but I still use Apple for my Mac. However, the latest announcements didn't give me any reason to switch back from Samsung. The Galaxy Fold 4, for example, has features I love, like its foldable design. Apple's dilemma is that they make great hardware, but few reasons to upgrade. I could easily use an iPhone XS and not notice a difference. Software-wise, Samsung's OneUI allows me to customize features to my liking, which is more appealing than Apple's approach.</td>\n",

I use Bitwarden. If they just plug into the existing extensibility model, and this new app is treated the same as a third-party option, then I’m happy.   \n",

We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 \"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\". Romans 10:13 states \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\". \\r\\n\\r\\n   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.   \n",

MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world.\\n\\nOk, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks:\\n\\nIt’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question.\\n\\nYou can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly.\\n\\nIt can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want.\\n\\nYou can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers.\\n\\nThe features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools?\\n\\nThe first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic. \\n\\nIn this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer.\\n\\nAnything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire \\n\\n\\nThat calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad.\\n\\nThe second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons?\\n\\nFinally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all.\\n\\nYou don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype.\\n\\nThis reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing).\\n\\nIt’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives.\\n\\nOther examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.   \n",

intelligence and in the end they said only iphone 15 pro models, is like... 😂 okay apple, not all people can afford a 1100 and 1300 dollars usd smartphones, thanks, steve jobs said that apple is for the humanity and to give them technology to improve people's lifes, apple had vision, tim cook did it until 2018, then everything has go slowly downhill, not all of it of course, but very down, not only that, but jobs said that according to our efforts we decide the price of our products, we try the most to price it correctly, well that was in 2009, and for your knowledge, apple intelligence is only available for 2 iphones (of more than 24 iphones eligible for the ios 18 update *oh is because they don't have 6gb of ram, well darling the Android phone of my Granny costs 200 dollars and has 8gb of ddr4 ram and on screen ai analysis to summarize websites with Gemini for free -well you exchange your data even when they say no but i don't believe any company in terms of 100% privacy so it's meh for me, is logic, that's why USA gov wants to ban TikTok cuz they don't have control over their info and the excuse is that they are \"spies\"-, apple does not use a \"unique physical ram\" to justify their price, like i say.. thefts*) but hey you have good animations :D and \"the ecosystem\" that windows and android are reaching more fast than ever to the point of apple, apple= no moral and respectful for people's money and time (so contrary to Steve's apple), yeah they have good and incredible things like the integration of apple intelligence offline but it doesn't help the fact that whenever they do something great they put it like god's new technology to justify prices in this times when they are not the unique smartphone company they were in 2007-2018, others are in the same level or little lower or little higher than them in terms of technology, i hope that the apple directive is changed but that will not happen because money runs the world and if they are still selling, nothing will change. \\n\\nP.d. They said thar A17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really? They always said new processors of apple silicon are the most fastest in the world all the time, the processor of the iphone 14 pro max is slow? Gosh they are really inmoral capitalists (i agree with capitalism and liberal economies)   \n",

Others spend time babbling and trying to be funny and you sound like a tech guy giving us tech news. I have a suggestion to take you to a new level. I have been writing Apple for years. I honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. I’ll share them in a moment. By the way I am a software engineer. I am not one who thinks I am so D smart or the smarted person in the room. I love to always learn and ai find I am always learning new things from you. So my idea for you is a real tech news Channel. This will make you something like the Wal Mart of tech news. This idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. I tried to float this to Apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. We have CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iPhone is released. Tech news is happening every day all day. I say join forces with some of the best like yourself, Brian Tong, possibly some from Engadget and create a real Tech News channel. It’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. EVs and Republicans wanting to K EVs, TicTok, Twitter. With social media companies being as influential as they have become. They’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. A real tech news channel will do this. What you and others do is journalism. I want the news to still be fun but I want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a CNN. You will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech CEO’s. It’s a militia billion. Dollar idea I am giving to you. This is something new of its kind and needed. Tech is no longer just mobile. We have stepped into the world of AI and Humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will I pack them. I would love to work with you as a producer or something. I have a huge idea and it will work.   \n",

Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face.\\n====================================\\nMy requirements for a phone are actually quite simple: \\n-a camera with acceptable image quality\\n-no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display\\n-stereo front-facing speakers\\n-a headphone jack as backup for when I need it\\n-expandable storage for when I need it\\n-the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS\\n\\nThus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone.\\n====================================\\nOkay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see.\\n====================================\\nI honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet.\\n====================================\\nI'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.   \n",

This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray.\\n\\nI predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that. \\n\\nThe only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”. \\n\\nThis isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability. \\nLast time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected. \\nFurthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac. \\n- why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing? \\nAnother thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got:\\n- better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago)\\n- Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind. \\n\\nA few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.   \n",

There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance:\\n\\n1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri.\\n2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap.\\n3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat.\\n4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.  \\n5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.)\\n6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.)\\n\\nI get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.   \n",

I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions. \\n\\nI could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter!\\n\\nI just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro. \\n\\nThis came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\"\\n\\nI already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup. \\n\\nApple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels.\\n\\nSoftwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works.\\n\\nSo, I'm out, except for Mac.   \n",

But God sent Jesus as a sinless sacrifice to take on all our sins, past, present, and future. Jesus died on the cross, shed his blood as atonement, and rose from the dead on the 3rd day. He showed life after death and everlasting life through his sacrifice. To gain eternal life in Heaven, all you have to do is believe that Jesus died for your sins and rose from the dead. Just ask Jesus to save you and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. I'm sharing this message because I want to reach people and get them to think about salvation and life after death. Satan wants to distract us and keep us from seeking eternal life in Heaven. Please don't wait - ask Jesus to save you from your sins and give you a place in Heaven.  \n",

MKBHD called it the only \"incredible feature\" from WWDC, but it's hardly used in real-world scenarios. The app can give answers as you write down a math question, adjust variables, and add graphs. However, these features are useless beyond 4th grade, as more complex math requires mental arithmetic and showing working out. A physical calculator is better for exams, as it's faster, easier, and representative of actual exam conditions. The iPad calculator app is inferior and can be replaced by a $200 physical calculator like the TI-Nspire. The app's features are impressive, but they're not practical or useful beyond primary school. Free software like Geogebra and Desmos offer more features and are just as good, if not better, than the iPad calculator. The physical calculator is just as good, if not better, for math work, and the iPad app is a complete gimmick. We need to stop blindly following hype and reflect on how features would be used in real-world scenarios. The chances are, they're pretty useless and easily replaceable with cheaper alternatives.  \n",

This exclusivity is frustrating, especially considering the high prices, up to $1300. Steve Jobs' vision for Apple was to make technology accessible to humanity, but under Tim Cook's leadership, prices have increased and the company's priorities have shifted. Apple claims to price their products fairly, but this is contradictory to the experience of many customers. The availability of Apple Intelligence is limited to only two iPhone models, when some Android phones costing as little as $200 have similar features. Apple's use of unique physical RAM is not justified by their prices. The company's focus on animations and ecosystem is not enough to compensate for their lack of moral and respectful treatment of customers' money and time. The integration of Apple Intelligence offline is impressive, but it doesn't excuse the company's behavior. Apple claims the A17 Pro chipset is necessary for Apple Intelligence, but this contradicts their previous claims that their processors are the fastest in the world. Ultimately, I hope Apple's approach will change, but I fear that greed and profits will drive their decisions.  \n",
       "8   The WWDC keynote was exciting, with AI playing a major role. Vision OS 2.0 introduces new features like wrist-turn gestures and quick access to the control center. iOS got a major update with customizable home screens and a new theme engine. Mac mirroring resolution was improved, and new tools are available for creating spatial and immersive videos. Other updates include scheduling text messages, text formatting, and automatic categorization in the mail app. AirPods got minor updates, including voice isolation and spatial audio. Apple TV updates include showing actor names on screen and boosting voices over music. iPad OS allows remote control of someone's iPad and has an impressive calculator app. Mac OS got a new version called Sequoia, featuring automatic window snapping and a new password app. Apple rebranded AI as Apple Intelligence, bringing new generative models and large language models to supported devices. Apple handles most AI tasks on-device, using Apple-built models for faster processing. The company also has two alternative approaches for handling complex tasks. Apple ensures privacy and security by not storing requests and obscuring IP addresses. I believe Apple's AI features are superior due to personalization and existing user info. The AI announcements mark a new age for Apple, and I'm excited to explore its capabilities. I'll be creating more videos about Apple's AI features and encourage viewers to subscribe for updates.  \n",

As a software engineer, I value your expertise and enjoy learning from you. My suggestion is to create a dedicated tech news channel, similar to CNN or ABC News, but focused on tech. This channel could feature in-depth interviews with tech CEOs and news anchors. I believe this idea could make you a prominent figure in the tech industry, even rivaling the likes of Brian Tong and Engadget. The tech industry is constantly evolving, with new and innovative products being released daily. A dedicated tech news channel would provide a platform to cover these developments, keeping viewers informed and engaged. I've had my own ideas for tech products and companies, and I'm convinced that some of my concepts have been used by Apple. Unfortunately, my suggestion for a tech news channel was rejected by Apple. I believe your channel could be a game-changer, providing a daily dose of tech news and analysis. I'd love to be a part of it as a producer or contributor.  \n",

Currently, they're heavy and cumbersome, making them difficult to wear for extended periods. My phone requirements are simple: good camera, no notch, stereo speakers, headphone jack, expandable storage, and a customizable home screen. Unfortunately, few devices meet these criteria, and the iPhone has never been one of them. I recently used the new calculator app on iPad OS 18, which is an impressive hands-on application of OCR and AI. However, it's not for me since my handwriting is poor. I'm unimpressed with AI features, as they often struggle with understanding the English language. Photo editing is a good use case, but even then, it relies on proper camera settings. I'd prefer AI to optimize shots and merge images like the Light camera. I'm disappointed Apple didn't announce updates to their TOTL Mac products, and I'm eager to know when the next generation of devices will be available.  \n",

Many of these features were already available on Mac, such as summarized notifications, which I had requested be brought to iPads and iPhones. Features like Tapback options and image generation were already available on other platforms like WhatsApp and Google Photos. This year's WWDC showed incremental updates with some original features like image and emoji generation, but these don't justify the high cost of the iPad Pro. I miss the days when Apple released feature-packed updates for MacOS X, but now we're stuck with incremental updates and increasing bugs. The iPad, in particular, has become more buggy and neglected. I'm skeptical about the value of the iPad Pro, which can't match the capabilities of the Mac or iPhone. Features like app organization and window management, which are now available on Mac, should have come to the iPad sooner. It's clear that Apple prioritizes iPhone features over iPad and Mac.  \n",

The generative features feel like they're overkill, and I prefer Apple's Siri over Microsoft's. The color-tinted icons remind me of cheap icon packs from years ago, and I'm not a fan of Apple's password solution. I use Bitwarden, so I hope they don't push their solution on me. I'm surprised by the blatant ChatGPT branding in the user experience, as it feels un-Apple like. On the other hand, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS, and I appreciate the improved search functionality. However, I'm not a fan of Stage Manager, and I hope I can continue to use my preferred shortcuts. I also think it's ironic that the Settings app is complicated enough that Apple is using AI to navigate through it. As a Software Engineer and consumer, I'm always uncomfortable with feature bloat. Despite this, I'm looking forward to getting my hands on this release and exploring the new features.  \n",

I already use 1Password, so Apple Passwords was unnecessary. I also found similar functionality with BetterTouchTool's snap functions. What I really miss is improved virtual desktop handling on Mac, which I use daily. I traded in my 2017 iPad Pro for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+, getting most of the new features at a lower cost. The S9+ has a 16:10 format, which is not ideal, but it's more compact than the old iPad Pro. I may have moved away from iOS, but I still use Apple for my Mac. However, the latest announcements didn't give me any reason to switch back from Samsung. The Galaxy Fold 4, for example, has features I love, like its foldable design. Apple's dilemma is that they make great hardware, but few reasons to upgrade. I could easily use an iPhone XS and not notice a difference. Software-wise, Samsung's OneUI allows me to customize features to my liking, which is more appealing than Apple's approach.  "

I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri.\\n2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap.\\n3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat.\\n4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.  \\n5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.)\\n6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.)\\n\\nI get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.</td>\n",

       "      <td>My takeaway was that across MacOS, iOS and iPadOS I found very few things that I could tell I would include in my daily use.\\n\\nI already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions. \\n\\nI could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter!\\n\\nI just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro. \\n\\nThis came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\"\\n\\nI already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup. \\n\\nApple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels.\\n\\nSoftwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works.\\n\\nSo, I'm out, except for Mac.</td>\n",

I also found similar functionality with BetterTouchTool's snap functions. What I really miss is improved virtual desktop handling on Mac, which I use daily. I traded in my 2017 iPad Pro for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+, getting most of the new features at a lower cost. The S9+ has a 16:10 format, which is not ideal, but it's more compact than the old iPad Pro. I may have moved away from iOS, but I still use Apple for my Mac. However, the latest announcements didn't give me any reason to switch back from Samsung. The Galaxy Fold 4, for example, has features I love, like its foldable design. Apple's dilemma is that they make great hardware, but few reasons to upgrade. I could easily use an iPhone XS and not notice a difference. Software-wise, Samsung's OneUI allows me to customize features to my liking, which is more appealing than Apple's approach.</td>\n",

       "11661                                                                                           **Lots** of great updates. There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance:\\n\\n1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri.\\n2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap.\\n3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat.\\n4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.  \\n5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.)\\n6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.)\\n\\nI get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.   \n",
       "11662  My takeaway was that across MacOS, iOS and iPadOS I found very few things that I could tell I would include in my daily use.\\n\\nI already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions. \\n\\nI could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter!\\n\\nI just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro. \\n\\nThis came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\"\\n\\nI already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup. \\n\\nApple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels.\\n\\nSoftwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works.\\n\\nSo, I'm out, except for Mac.   \n",
