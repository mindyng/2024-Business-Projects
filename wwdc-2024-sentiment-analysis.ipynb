But don’t forget when you buy a Android phone don’t buy the cheapest one because you need at least a medium performance processor so you good on average price don’t need to be a top line or a flagship Android phone but if you can affordit better., I think the icon redesign is great, let me do what I want . If I want a dinosaur theme for example let me be 😂. Of course this has existed on android for years but this is “ the apple way”  as they call it. I never had an issue with Home Screen I thought it was fine but hey I might just a boring person I guess.

To be honest every person that have both phones straight away agree with me, basically if you only use Android phone you don’t understand that your phone Operating System is so blast advanced.\\nOn the other hand a person that uses only IPhone don’t understand how basic the IOS iPhone operating system it is compared to Android Operating system software looks like living in a stone age, honestly just to put you in perspective when you use Android phone feels like the Android phone user is already in 2035 at least . But don’t forget when you buy a Android phone don’t buy the cheapest one because you need at least a medium performance processor so you good on average price don’t need to be a top line or a flagship Android phone but if you can affordit better., I think the icon redesign is great, let me do what I want . If I want a dinosaur theme for example let me be 😂. Of course this has existed on android for years but this is “ the apple way”  as they call it. I never had an issue with Home Screen I thought it was fine but hey I might just a boring person I guess. Interesting changes, in all honesty I don’t know if this will change my experience on my phone including the Mac and iPad version but hey! It’s a software update I can’t say no]  \n",
