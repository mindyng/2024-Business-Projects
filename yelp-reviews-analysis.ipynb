I think we might have tried it once a year or two ago, but it wasn't memorable.  I decided to try the HK-style milk tea not too long ago and was hooked.  I think I went here almost every day one week to get the milk tea, only to realize that I should REALLY watch my sugar intake...it's sooo good!  \\n\\nI personally don't think it's better than Zhong Gang's HK-style milk tea because they have their off days when a certain lady makes them (not enough ice, too much ice, etc.).\\n\\nOn a side note:  I wanted to try the crispy roast pork bun, but accidentally said the wrong name in Chinese and got the roast pork bun.

The female cashier was very friendly (flirtatious!) and the pastries shown in nicely adorned display cases. I stopped by early one evening had a sesame ball, which was filled with bean paste. The glutinous rice of the ball was nicely flavored, similar to Bai Tang Gao. Definitely as place worth stopping at if you are in the area.   \n",

They have a decent variety of buns and pastries.  Red bean-filled buns, mung bean-filled buns, coconut stuff, egg tarts etc.  If you buy a dozen, they will give you two more for free.  The prices are standard for a Chinese bakery, with most things at approximately $1.  The service has always been good.  They do serve coffee and tea.  There are a couple of tables inside, with usually the expected group of older Chinese guys chillin' in the corner table debating about something.  Great place to stock up on the buns, which I usually do before leaving town.   \n",

There are a couple of tables inside, with usually the expected group of older Chinese guys chillin' in the corner table debating about something.  Great place to stock up on the buns, which I usually do before leaving town.</td>\n",

The prices are affordable, the portions are generous, the staff is friendly, and the food is AMAZING. \\n\\nThe last time I went to the Plum Pit, I ordered a jerk chicken sandwich to split with a friend. Learn from our mistake--order your own sandwich, and if you can't finish it, save half for later. We ended up going back for another sandwich (the one with chicken tenders, mac &amp; cheese, and bacon--I can't remember the name) anyway. We also got two orders of bread pudding to bring home, which, though pretty good cold, is ever better when you heat it up in the oven for 10-15 minutes.</td>\n",

I only wish I lived closer to Philly so that I could eat here more often. The prices are affordable, the portions are generous, the staff is friendly, and the food is AMAZING. \\n\\nThe last time I went to the Plum Pit, I ordered a jerk chicken sandwich to split with a friend. Learn from our mistake--order your own sandwich, and if you can't finish it, save half for later. We ended up going back for another sandwich (the one with chicken tenders, mac & cheese, and bacon--I can't remember the name) anyway. We also got two orders of bread pudding to bring home, which, though pretty good cold, is ever better when you heat it up in the oven for 10-15 minutes.  \n",

Stupidly delicious. \\n\\nShould be a 4.5 because they were a little slow compared to other trucks, but once the food showed up, totally ON POINT.\\n\\nWe had the bacon Mac and cheese with the French fry bowl, topped with jerk chicken. I could not get enough of the jerk chicken. And the bacon Mac and cheese was super creamy ( again 4.5 we saw a big can of nacho cheese instead of good cheese \" . \\n\\nWould definitely eat here again if they were at the Stables.  \n",

This food was really good! We all got one of almost everything and tasted it. We were so surprised.  The portion size was on point! Chef Floyd and T (Angie was her name on the contract) did a great job executing the orders in the heat. They made a great team. They worked very well together and had a great sense of humor. The next time I'm in the area, I will definitely look them up. If you are having an event and are in or around the Media, Pennsylvania area you should definitely look them up and have their food truck at your next event!  \n",

Lots of space for sitting down and to hang. Around 1pm on a Monday, not crowded but certainly not empty. Always a good sign. People studying and on their laptops. Outlets and different sized work spaces throughout. Water bowl and free small dog treats at the counter. Community bike pump for free use strapped to the entrance stair rail. Cool shop. I'd def come back to for a work spot and truly explore their generous  drink and food menu.</td>\n",

It is a sushi take on the cheesesteak. It is light and delicious - light compared to a cheesesteak not other sushi. It came I wrapped in a Japanese newspaper which was great touch. I really enjoyed it, but I'm not sure I would get it again just because I really enjoy getting fish when I get sushi but it is worth the try once. A great signature. \\n\\nWe also tried the red dragon roll which was a special which was delicious - so fresh and light with the seasoning they had in top. I would get this roll again. Then we got two spicy crunchy tunas which are a staple when we get sushi and were great. Everything was very good , but I would say it is very pricey we spent 80 dollars on the meal.\\n\\nOverall it was a good meal, the ambiance is very average, the waiter was very friendly ,but the food is very expensive.</td>\n",

Has an eclectic, artsy vibe to the space. Prices comparable to other trendy shops in the area. I ventured in for quick cup of coffee to go and check out the place. Lots of space for sitting down and to hang. Around 1pm on a Monday, not crowded but certainly not empty. Always a good sign. People studying and on their laptops. Outlets and different sized work spaces throughout. Water bowl and free small dog treats at the counter. Community bike pump for free use strapped to the entrance stair rail. Cool shop. I'd def come back to for a work spot and truly explore their generous  drink and food menu.   \n",

I am surprised they are not busy. Maybe it's their location way in the back of the shopping center. The waitstaff is very nice, fluent in English and Spanish, and the food is really good. Huge portions. Fed us well, with leftovers for lunch tomorrow. So much better than most of the other Mexican places we have tried.   \n",

       "1855630  This is a great date night spot. My boyfriend and I got the ginger salad which is a decent size and nice to split between two people as a starter. The salad was perfectly seasoned with the ginger dressing. Some other places put the ginger dressings on top and let it sit but as Zama they mix it together like a chopped salad and it was amazing. We also got the Shrimp lettuce wraps which  tasted superb, but nothing to brag about.\\n\\nFor an entree we got the Philly cheesesteak roll and it was something like I have seen anywhere else. It is a sushi take on the cheesesteak. It is light and delicious - light compared to a cheesesteak not other sushi. It came I wrapped in a Japanese newspaper which was great touch. I really enjoyed it, but I'm not sure I would get it again just because I really enjoy getting fish when I get sushi but it is worth the try once. A great signature. \\n\\nWe also tried the red dragon roll which was a special which was delicious - so fresh and light with the seasoning they had in top. I would get this roll again. Then we got two spicy crunchy tunas which are a staple when we get sushi and were great. Everything was very good , but I would say it is very pricey we spent 80 dollars on the meal.\\n\\nOverall it was a good meal, the ambiance is very average, the waiter was very friendly ,but the food is very expensive.   \n",

One had chopped steak and one had steak. I had the the chicken fried steak and was ok. The veggies were surprisingly good. Would come back if the location was convenient!   \n",

Dirty, even with a remodel, mistakes on orders frequently, and now add arrogant order takers to the list. Help must be very hard to come by. I am used to McDonald's being relatively reliable places. Not so here, and they have had plenty of chances. Not going back.   \n",

Has an eclectic, artsy vibe to the space. Prices comparable to other trendy shops in the area. I ventured in for quick cup of coffee to go and check out the place. Lots of space for sitting down and to hang. Around 1pm on a Monday, not crowded but certainly not empty. Always a good sign. People studying and on their laptops. Outlets and different sized work spaces throughout. Water bowl and free small dog treats at the counter. Community bike pump for free use strapped to the entrance stair rail. Cool shop. I'd def come back to for a work spot and truly explore their generous  drink and food menu.  \n",

I am surprised they are not busy. Maybe it's their location way in the back of the shopping center. The waitstaff is very nice, fluent in English and Spanish, and the food is really good. Huge portions. Fed us well, with leftovers for lunch tomorrow. So much better than most of the other Mexican places we have tried.  \n",

       "1855630  This is a great date night spot. My boyfriend and I got the ginger salad which is a decent size and nice to split between two people as a starter. The salad was perfectly seasoned with the ginger dressing. Some other places put the ginger dressings on top and let it sit but as Zama they mix it together like a chopped salad and it was amazing. We also got the Shrimp lettuce wraps which  tasted superb, but nothing to brag about. For an entree we got the Philly cheesesteak roll and it was something like I have seen anywhere else. It is a sushi take on the cheesesteak. It is light and delicious - light compared to a cheesesteak not other sushi. It came I wrapped in a Japanese newspaper which was great touch. I really enjoyed it, but I'm not sure I would get it again just because I really enjoy getting fish when I get sushi but it is worth the try once. A great signature.  We also tried the red dragon roll which was a special which was delicious - so fresh and light with the seasoning they had in top. I would get this roll again. Then we got two spicy crunchy tunas which are a staple when we get sushi and were great. Everything was very good , but I would say it is very pricey we spent 80 dollars on the meal. Overall it was a good meal, the ambiance is very average, the waiter was very friendly ,but the food is very expensive.  \n",

One had chopped steak and one had steak. I had the the chicken fried steak and was ok. The veggies were surprisingly good. Would come back if the location was convenient!  \n",

Dirty, even with a remodel, mistakes on orders frequently, and now add arrogant order takers to the list. Help must be very hard to come by. I am used to McDonald's being relatively reliable places. Not so here, and they have had plenty of chances. Not going back.  \n",

Super impressed with how calm and efficient the servers were despite it being very busy - amazing food portions and prices- the food was so so good. Turkey melt sandwich was satisfying and blueberry pancakes did not disappoint  Cons- inside the reading terminal market so expect to find street parking - can get very crowded on the weekends - only offer bar type seating  \n",

       "32564   Pleasantly surprised. I tend to order from same places bc what's worse than paying for mediocre food? My boyfriend finally convinced me one day to step out of my comfort zone and we settled on Speedy's. We each got a cheesesteak and also a small pepperoni. The cheesesteaks were REALLY good. Not the absolute best but GOOD, and dare I say the best for this area (greater Northeast). Meat, cheese, bread ratio was on point. Flavoring was good. Portion size was just right, thick enough to fill you up but not to the point the sandwich was sloppy with meat flying everywhere. I will def get a cheesesteak from here again. As for the pizza, I took a few bites and it just didn't do it for me. My boyfriend said it was ok but I'm a self proclaimed pizza snob so I was disappointed. I may say screw it though and give their pizza another try. Oh and the name fits them well. Our food was ready for pickup in 15 minutes. That means a lot during the lunch rush. A lot of places will tell you a time and then have you waiting around like you don't have to get back to work, not the case with this joint. I will be back for more.   \n",

Table and booths were greasy. Bathroom was gross. Waiters, hostess and chefs were loudly yelling at and fighting with each other, repeatedly. I only had a sundae, and it was delicious, but took 15 minutes. It also seemed small and expensive. The dish was no where near as full as the menu picture. I have had many sundaes at local establishments, and this was by far the least ice cream for the most money. But, again, it was delicious. Server was very nice. I would only return to get ice cream from the take out window. Their WiFi is free but pathetically slow.   \n",

Zin burger with a truffle aioli, sweet potato fries - must try. And a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon, what can be a better treat after busy Monday? Highly recommend this place.

       "20  i would like to share an experience i had here last night. i have always enjoyed taking my family here. the service has been great and the food even better. yet last night taking my children and wife out was a very different experience where i decided i will not be dining here any longer. we were greeted and our order was taken. the lady was friendly and helpful. as for the men in the back i would be ashamed as an owner to have someone like the men in the back working for me. they were rude and disrespectful to the lady in the front. children and families were around and he was making a scene. at one point i got up to make sure everything was okay since the man in the back kept coming up front and saying things to the lady. the lady was clearly embarrassed and kept apologizing to everyone. another lady had came into the restaurant to help out and the argument in the back with the men still happened. i love the food and the experience most of the time except last night. no women should ever be treated in a manor where they are made to cry and apologizing for someone else behavior. if i was the owner i would have a good long talk with the men. if you would also like i can let everyone know what was going on. i recorded it.   \n",

       "6   what a fun, delicious-looking restaurant. and as long as you don't go through the drive-through,  you'll be able to enjoy their food.  my group of four stopped by to try their food for the first time. we were handed our shakes and a large sack of food. time to hit the open road and enjoy some steak & shake.  as we passed out booty the harsh reality set in of our predicament began to set. the driver was missing his burger. his wingman was missing his fries. my backseat cohort had the wrong sandwich and was missing all the dipping sauce to boot. and then there was me. the guy paying for the meal who decided to eat healthy.  i stared at my salad trough the plastic lid. it was covered in sour cream and looked somewhat appealing, but since i was not given a fork i was left with two options. option 1. attempt to eat the salad and get sour cream, grease, etc all over my fingers (and probably on my clothes and ipad). option 2. pick up my ipad and write a yelp review as i stare at the steam from the fresh cooked hamburger on the salad rise against the plastic cover; tempting me to risk going 'caveman' on my food, but i resist.  why didn't we turn around and go back to complain? traffic, no time. i wish i could have so i could do a fair review.  as for the sparse items we did receive here is the report: shakes - goodburgers - oksandwich that was missing the dipping sauce - the bread was good, the rest was lacking. probably better with dipping sauce. fries - average, but far from great. no comparisons against mcdonalds. thanks for the experience - makes me appreciate the consistency of mcdonalds.   \n",

(i mean it, make the reservations early and then get there 2 hours later, i'm sure good 'ol ken will still make you wait with sweet promises too!)(the g-rated version) at the end of our \"adventurous\" night, someone finally spoke up (you know who you are &amp; thank you!) after ken tried to work his magic on her, but she clearly told him we all obviously were skeeved out since the multiple times he came into our private room, we would all huddle together in 1 corner.  he looked confused and ironically drunk off his watered down drinks &amp; made a pathetic apology. he then stormed off, but his cheap hollow door wouldn't give him the effect he was trying for.  but then he showed us by giving us our bill with our original total crossed off &amp; adding an extra $20 to it.  we decided not to leave a tip since we figured he tried to have his way with all of us (he doesn't discriminate either) so that was a big tip in itself.  apparently, these smooth cat moves may have worked in the past for him, so i guess we \"missed out\".but don't let any of this deter you from trying this place out.  just don't forget to bring your mace.  and eat ahead of time.</td>\n",

       "      <td>pleasantly surprised. i tend to order from same places bc what's worse than paying for mediocre food? my boyfriend finally convinced me one day to step out of my comfort zone and we settled on speedy's. we each got a cheesesteak and also a small pepperoni. the cheesesteaks were really good. not the absolute best but good, and dare i say the best for this area (greater northeast). meat, cheese, bread ratio was on point. flavoring was good. portion size was just right, thick enough to fill you up but not to the point the sandwich was sloppy with meat flying everywhere. i will def get a cheesesteak from here again. as for the pizza, i took a few bites and it just didn't do it for me. my boyfriend said it was ok but i'm a self proclaimed pizza snob so i was disappointed. i may say screw it though and give their pizza another try. oh and the name fits them well. our food was ready for pickup in 15 minutes. that means a lot during the lunch rush. a lot of places will tell you a time and then have you waiting around like you don't have to get back to work, not the case with this joint. i will be back for more.</td>\n",

       "1     pleasantly surprised. i tend to order from same places bc what's worse than paying for mediocre food? my boyfriend finally convinced me one day to step out of my comfort zone and we settled on speedy's. we each got a cheesesteak and also a small pepperoni. the cheesesteaks were really good. not the absolute best but good, and dare i say the best for this area (greater northeast). meat, cheese, bread ratio was on point. flavoring was good. portion size was just right, thick enough to fill you up but not to the point the sandwich was sloppy with meat flying everywhere. i will def get a cheesesteak from here again. as for the pizza, i took a few bites and it just didn't do it for me. my boyfriend said it was ok but i'm a self proclaimed pizza snob so i was disappointed. i may say screw it though and give their pizza another try. oh and the name fits them well. our food was ready for pickup in 15 minutes. that means a lot during the lunch rush. a lot of places will tell you a time and then have you waiting around like you don't have to get back to work, not the case with this joint. i will be back for more.   \n",

       "3  i was expecting something that would be pretty decent when i was paying $8 for a burger, taking into account that it does not come with any sides. but the first sign that i knew it wasnt going to be particularly good was that the lamb burger, despite being lamb, was cheaper than most other burgers on the menu... while the burger was hot and fresh, it took a little while to come out yet it still looked like it was simply slapped together. the toppings were scarce and only in the center of the burger, leaving half of it with just lamb patty and bun. the burger in general was simply not tasty despite the delicious sounding ingredients. overall, i might consider eating here again because of their interesting items and variety; however, if i'm looking for a burger, i would much rather go to the habit or any other burger joint even if its further away, simply because they're all either cheaper, better in quality, or both.   \n",

       "1     pleasantly surprised. i tend to order from same places bc what's worse than paying for mediocre food? my boyfriend finally convinced me one day to step out of my comfort zone and we settled on speedy's. we each got a cheesesteak and also a small pepperoni. the cheesesteaks were really good. not the absolute best but good, and dare i say the best for this area (greater northeast). meat, cheese, bread ratio was on point. flavoring was good. portion size was just right, thick enough to fill you up but not to the point the sandwich was sloppy with meat flying everywhere. i will def get a cheesesteak from here again. as for the pizza, i took a few bites and it just didn't do it for me. my boyfriend said it was ok but i'm a self proclaimed pizza snob so i was disappointed. i may say screw it though and give their pizza another try. oh and the name fits them well. our food was ready for pickup in 15 minutes. that means a lot during the lunch rush. a lot of places will tell you a time and then have you waiting around like you don't have to get back to work, not the case with this joint. i will be back for more.   \n",

    "High negative and high positive ratios correspond with neg/pos sentiments. Review sentiment composition gets murky with neutral sentiment since a neutral stance with a restaurant can have a bunch of negative or neutral comments. Would need to look at star rating to get a better view of what sentiment is majority in neutral classified reviews. Let's take a quick peek."

       "9  the service was excellent and most of the food was unique and prepared well. the octopus was tough and chewy, so the cook staff needs to work on that. the presentation was stellar however.   what really was the fatal flaw issue here is the automatic 20 percent gratuity that is tagged onto your bill, regardless of party size.  this is not normal. the dishes here are expensive enough, but four small plates, 2 beers, and 2 cocktails cost $170.  what ?  sales tax and gratuity accounted for $40.  furthermore, the restaurant adds the gratuity on top of the sales tax, so we are tipping the restaurant for paying the sales tax for us to the state.i'd rather go to a restaurant that allows me to feel benevolent with my tipping decisions based on service, food and experience.   when our waitress brought us the bill, she indicated that we had to go because our table was needed for upcoming reservations.  so with an automatic gratuity, the incentive for the restaurant to be cordial and accommodating (especially in a tourist town where tourists come and go) is largely removed.  and by the way, we are locals. i think there is a pretty good possibility that the probability of me referring this place to my friends, is zero.  at least until they backpedal on their gratuity policy which is shameful.   \n",

I think we might have tried it once a year or two ago, but it wasn't memorable.  I decided to try the HK-style milk tea not too long ago and was hooked.  I think I went here almost every day one week to get the milk tea, only to realize that I should REALLY watch my sugar intake...it's sooo good!  \\n\\nI personally don't think it's better than Zhong Gang's HK-style milk tea because they have their off days when a certain lady makes them (not enough ice, too much ice, etc.).\\n\\nOn a side note:  I wanted to try the crispy roast pork bun, but accidentally said the wrong name in Chinese and got the roast pork bun.  It was decent enough, although I will get to trying the crispy roast pork bun soon!  \\n\\nI will be back~</td>\n",

       "4  HK-STYLE MILK TEA:  FOUR STARS\\n\\nNot quite sure why there are two Saint Honore Pastries business listings on Yelp, but I have been checking in to this one.\\n\\nBoyfriend and I go by it all the time while in Chinatown, but it never crossed our mind to try it.  I think we might have tried it once a year or two ago, but it wasn't memorable.  I decided to try the HK-style milk tea not too long ago and was hooked.  I think I went here almost every day one week to get the milk tea, only to realize that I should REALLY watch my sugar intake...it's sooo good!  \\n\\nI personally don't think it's better than Zhong Gang's HK-style milk tea because they have their off days when a certain lady makes them (not enough ice, too much ice, etc.).\\n\\nOn a side note:  I wanted to try the crispy roast pork bun, but accidentally said the wrong name in Chinese and got the roast pork bun.  It was decent enough, although I will get to trying the crispy roast pork bun soon!  \\n\\nI will be back~   \n",

       "0  we stopped in here for lunch on saturday. the first thing we found out is that on weekends, they only have the dinner menu. no big deal, as i was starving, but some lunch options would have been nice. we got bruschetta and calamari for appetizers. the calamari was delicious - it comes sauteed in marinara, and it was perfectly cooked and tender. my only gripe is that i expected more than what we got for $14. for lunch i got the eggplant parm. portion size was not an issue this time, as i got more than enough to fill me up. it was pretty good, but i felt the marinara sauce was mediocre at best. one person with me got spaghetti and meatballs, which he said was delicious; another got chicken caesar salad and did not like the dressing that came with it. the service was also up and down as well. our waiter was practically mumbling at the beginning of our meal, but by the end had woken up a bit. the hit or miss nature of ralph's led me to give it 3 stars. it was an overall pleasant experience, but nothing to write home about   \n",

       "6  i, personally, have been eating your food since the very begining. i have even eaten at both restaurants in portland. it was to far to drive, to come back home! i have enjoyed your pizza begining with the first bite. all this being said...our visit to the new restaurant in meridian was a nightmare. the noise level was unbearable!! the noise eminating from the kitchen was the worst of it. i can't complain about the \"music\"  because you could not hear the music. i was reminded of my time in the marine corps in the mid-60's...a chow hall...have to say it made me long for the chow hall! the service was a combo...the young man was rude, the young lady looked as if she would love to be anywhere else. i couldn't believe what i experienced...then i was reading your timeline...a new owner...hum...ya know, i couldn't believe that you closed on broadway...must have lost a fortune, with that move. but you didn't lose your identity. kept on moving forward...we love you! my point is that some one made a really bad decision in meridian. it's obvious that you made the move there for the money! we won't be back to this site ever. really, no shades on the late afternoon windows? flies? the front door was wide open for most of our stay! my wife even went up to pay at the bar on the way out, and complained about the volume of flies and the young ladies response was paraphrasing...this isn't that bad, barbacoa is way worse. really? the wife was stupefied!!! a truly horrible experience. it's a damned good thing the two stores in boise are still open...for the time being. a loyal customer michael fisher   \n",

       "15  wow. we went at 3pm and the line was a 30 minute wait, so go on a day that you are feeling rather patient. it is well worth the wait. i ordered the pork, peppers and tortillas combo, boyfriend got the chicken with bell pepper and onion, and we shared the quesadilla and chile relleno. the chile relleno was the special of the day and was amazing with potato, zucchini, green beans, cheese and tomato stuffed inside of a long, deep fried chile. the pork pastilla dish i got was unreal- the flavor of the pork was fantastic, and the homemade corn tortillas had the best flavor and texture i've ever had in a corn tortilla. the maza was so fresh and you can see them making the tortillas and grilling everything on the grill, which is really nice.  their pico de gallo and guacamole rock. this place is out of this world and very unique style of food. i wish we would have gotten the tamale special. their mexican rice is also fabulous and not too greasy or heavy. the quesadilla was rather bland and was the one thing we probably would pass on in the future.   \n",

       "15  wow. we went at 3pm and the line was a 30 minute wait, so go on a day that you are feeling rather patient. it is well worth the wait. i ordered the pork, peppers and tortillas combo, boyfriend got the chicken with bell pepper and onion, and we shared the quesadilla and chile relleno. the chile relleno was the special of the day and was amazing with potato, zucchini, green beans, cheese and tomato stuffed inside of a long, deep fried chile. the pork pastilla dish i got was unreal- the flavor of the pork was fantastic, and the homemade corn tortillas had the best flavor and texture i've ever had in a corn tortilla. the maza was so fresh and you can see them making the tortillas and grilling everything on the grill, which is really nice.  their pico de gallo and guacamole rock. this place is out of this world and very unique style of food. i wish we would have gotten the tamale special. their mexican rice is also fabulous and not too greasy or heavy. the quesadilla was rather bland and was the one thing we probably would pass on in the future.   \n",

       "15  wow. we went at 3pm and the line was a 30 minute wait, so go on a day that you are feeling rather patient. it is well worth the wait. i ordered the pork, peppers and tortillas combo, boyfriend got the chicken with bell pepper and onion, and we shared the quesadilla and chile relleno. the chile relleno was the special of the day and was amazing with potato, zucchini, green beans, cheese and tomato stuffed inside of a long, deep fried chile. the pork pastilla dish i got was unreal- the flavor of the pork was fantastic, and the homemade corn tortillas had the best flavor and texture i've ever had in a corn tortilla. the maza was so fresh and you can see them making the tortillas and grilling everything on the grill, which is really nice.  their pico de gallo and guacamole rock. this place is out of this world and very unique style of food. i wish we would have gotten the tamale special. their mexican rice is also fabulous and not too greasy or heavy. the quesadilla was rather bland and was the one thing we probably would pass on in the future.   \n",
