The female cashier was very friendly (flirtatious!) and the pastries shown in nicely adorned display cases. I stopped by early one evening had a sesame ball, which was filled with bean paste. The glutinous rice of the ball was nicely flavored, similar to Bai Tang Gao. Definitely as place worth stopping at if you are in the area.   \n",

They have a decent variety of buns and pastries.  Red bean-filled buns, mung bean-filled buns, coconut stuff, egg tarts etc.  If you buy a dozen, they will give you two more for free.  The prices are standard for a Chinese bakery, with most things at approximately $1.  The service has always been good.  They do serve coffee and tea.  There are a couple of tables inside, with usually the expected group of older Chinese guys chillin' in the corner table debating about something.  Great place to stock up on the buns, which I usually do before leaving town.   \n",

The female cashier was very friendly (flirtatious!) and the pastries shown in nicely adorned display cases. I stopped by early one evening had a sesame ball, which was filled with bean paste. The glutinous rice of the ball was nicely flavored, similar to Bai Tang Gao. Definitely as place worth stopping at if you are in the area.  \n",

They have a decent variety of buns and pastries.  Red bean-filled buns, mung bean-filled buns, coconut stuff, egg tarts etc.  If you buy a dozen, they will give you two more for free.  The prices are standard for a Chinese bakery, with most things at approximately $1.  The service has always been good.  They do serve coffee and tea.  There are a couple of tables inside, with usually the expected group of older Chinese guys chillin' in the corner table debating about something.  Great place to stock up on the buns, which I usually do before leaving town.  \n",

       "4        HK-STYLE MILK TEA:  FOUR STARS\\n\\nNot quite sure why there are two Saint Honore Pastries business listings on Yelp, but I have been checking in to this one.\\n\\nBoyfriend and I go by it all the time while in Chinatown, but it never crossed our mind to try it.  I think we might have tried it once a year or two ago, but it wasn't memorable.  I decided to try the HK-style milk tea not too long ago and was hooked.  I think I went here almost every day one week to get the milk tea, only to realize that I should REALLY watch my sugar intake...it's sooo good!  \\n\\nI personally don't think it's better than Zhong Gang's HK-style milk tea because they have their off days when a certain lady makes them (not enough ice, too much ice, etc.).\\n\\nOn a side note:  I wanted to try the crispy roast pork bun, but accidentally said the wrong name in Chinese and got the roast pork bun.  It was decent enough, although I will get to trying the crispy roast pork bun soon!  \\n\\nI will be back~  \n",

The prices are affordable, the portions are generous, the staff is friendly, and the food is AMAZING. \\n\\nThe last time I went to the Plum Pit, I ordered a jerk chicken sandwich to split with a friend. Learn from our mistake--order your own sandwich, and if you can't finish it, save half for later. We ended up going back for another sandwich (the one with chicken tenders, mac & cheese, and bacon--I can't remember the name) anyway. We also got two orders of bread pudding to bring home, which, though pretty good cold, is ever better when you heat it up in the oven for 10-15 minutes.  \n",

This food was really good! We all got one of almost everything and tasted it. We were so surprised.  The portion size was on point! Chef Floyd and T (Angie was her name on the contract) did a great job executing the orders in the heat. They made a great team. They worked very well together and had a great sense of humor. The next time I'm in the area, I will definitely look them up. If you are having an event and are in or around the Media, Pennsylvania area you should definitely look them up and have their food truck at your next event!  \n",

       "183042                   I was so impressed by this place! We came for brunch one weekend and I'm so glad we did.  The ambiance is absolutely stunning- high ceilings, beautiful decor. The food and drinks were equally as incredible. We had the Lebanese chai latte and the mule, both of which were unique and delicious. The menu has many things that all sound amazing, but we finally decided on a few smaller plates. For the price, the serving sizes were more than enough, and everything had so much wonderful flavor. I can't wait to come back and try everything they have, including their dinner menu. Highly recommend!   \n",

It took over an hour for our food to arrive. We couldn't find our server for most of the time. She never refilled our drinks, we had to chase down someone else working there for a refill. She never came back to check on us once the food came (and never apologized for it taking so long). I had to ask the hostess for our check. Terrible experience and don't eat here if you're a Celiac. They don't accommodate, I've gotten sick the two times I've eaten here.   \n",

       "3170074  Came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend. We were a little overwhelmed by all the options, but our server, Steven, took great care of us, helping us navigate the menu and making recommendations. The tonkatsu and tomato oxtail broths were both great! The waygu and uni sushi was melt-in-your-mouth delicious and worth the price. We had a hard time with the tiger shrimp shells and werent the biggest fan of the lobster meatballs but the waygu and ribeye meat options were awesome. Surprisingly, our favorite add-in was the shitaki mushrooms- so delicious. Would love to come back with a bigger group!   \n",

It took over an hour for our food to arrive. We couldn't find our server for most of the time. She never refilled our drinks, we had to chase down someone else working there for a refill. She never came back to check on us once the food came (and never apologized for it taking so long). I had to ask the hostess for our check. Terrible experience and don't eat here if you're a Celiac. They don't accommodate, I've gotten sick the two times I've eaten here.  \n",

       "3170074  Came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend. We were a little overwhelmed by all the options, but our server, Steven, took great care of us, helping us navigate the menu and making recommendations. The tonkatsu and tomato oxtail broths were both great! The waygu and uni sushi was melt-in-your-mouth delicious and worth the price. We had a hard time with the tiger shrimp shells and werent the biggest fan of the lobster meatballs but the waygu and ribeye meat options were awesome. Surprisingly, our favorite add-in was the shitaki mushrooms- so delicious. Would love to come back with a bigger group!  \n",

My sole problem is the spinach and artichoke dip. Just start over. It's horrible.  Turkey burger was so good. I would go back for that.  Service wasn't excellent, but it wasn't awful either. The waitress seemed new, but friendly enough.  It really was that dip. Yuck.  \n",

       "1  I was so impressed by this place! We came for brunch one weekend and I'm so glad we did.  The ambiance is absolutely stunning- high ceilings, beautiful decor. The food and drinks were equally as incredible. We had the Lebanese chai latte and the mule, both of which were unique and delicious. The menu has many things that all sound amazing, but we finally decided on a few smaller plates. For the price, the serving sizes were more than enough, and everything had so much wonderful flavor. I can't wait to come back and try everything they have, including their dinner menu. Highly recommend!   \n",

So instead just 4 rum cakes. The rum cakes used to be these really big cakes with a cherry on top for somewhere in the neighborhood of $4/each. My total was always $17 and change. Well, now the rum cakes are half the size, with half of a cherry and still, the total was $17 and change. Adjust the price and give a full cherry, goodness. We were so disappointed. Our first time back since quarantine. And it's likely our last.   \n",

       "220515  i have enjoyed sushi for a long time. my favorite was kokopelli's at circus circus. i have experiences at other places such as sushi pier, hiroba etc... however, i didn't notice this place before i received the advertised mail. i was very surprised at the wonderful sushi provided at this restaurant. for the nigiri, i cannot give them 5 stars. the amount of rice in nigiri is a little higher compared to raw fish amount. kokopelli's is the best for nigiri. however, i will give five stars to this restaurant. the rolls are the best.. the ratio of rice and contents are very good for taste. generally, the quality of raw fish is very good. the price is highly competitive in those good quality of food. their friendly service, short wait time for food, and other extras such as free beer, alcohol, and vip promotions are perfect additional benefits to their customers! i am very happy to have this wonderful place near my home.   \n",

       "      <td>travel post! coming from san diego we have very high standards for mexican cuisine. i had been scouring yelp to find a spot that would wow me and my family. this place did not disappoint. we really enjoyed the fast casual but clean ambiance. the part that we really enjoyed about this spot was how incredibly fresh each dish was. i ordered the tacos del mar and it was light and flavorful. the veggie enchiladas with the green sauce has a very pleasant tangy flavor. the chile relleno was super crispy with a really fresh red sauce. the tacos al pastor was had a deep smokey spicy flavor with a great pineapple relish that complimented the tacos very nicely. but the agaves enchiladas was something that greatly surprised us. the orange cream sauce went so well with the seafood inside the enchiladas. all the salsas at the salsa bar was also so delicious!  if you come here i highly recommend the tacos al pastor and the agaves enchiladas. the word we left here with was \"incredible\". thank you los agaves for an incredible meal! my family and i appreciated the meal so much!</td>\n",

       "      <td>a unique indy treat! spanish fusion that isn't overly pretentious or pricy. we started with empanadas: steak and chorizo. we got three apiece with an order which was almost a meal in itself for $9. the steak were savory and crisp with an unremarkable but tasty sauce. the chorizo however were amazing well balanced with subtle earthiness. the smoky salsa with a hint of sweet was a perfect pair. next i had the albÃ³ndigas, which was pretty much a standard meatball. it was tasty but a little to much chew for my taste if i'm going to be nit-picky. but a bite of fresh tomato sauce, the creamy hearty rissoto, the arugala and meatball is a heavenly bite i won't soon forget. a truly masterful dish. my partner had the paella, but i stole a bite. it's a dry paella with sauce on the side. the chorizo fried rice is amazing! just the perfect balance of savory, spicy with a creamy cilantro sauce to tame it. the seafood was perfectly spicy and charred. i would at least call it deconstructed myself. all the flavors on this plate are delicious. i'm just not sure i would call it paella. the rice could use more taste of the sea...but that is a small critic of a still amazing dish! i can't wait to try more.</td>\n",

       "0  i have enjoyed sushi for a long time. my favorite was kokopelli's at circus circus. i have experiences at other places such as sushi pier, hiroba etc... however, i didn't notice this place before i received the advertised mail. i was very surprised at the wonderful sushi provided at this restaurant. for the nigiri, i cannot give them 5 stars. the amount of rice in nigiri is a little higher compared to raw fish amount. kokopelli's is the best for nigiri. however, i will give five stars to this restaurant. the rolls are the best.. the ratio of rice and contents are very good for taste. generally, the quality of raw fish is very good. the price is highly competitive in those good quality of food. their friendly service, short wait time for food, and other extras such as free beer, alcohol, and vip promotions are perfect additional benefits to their customers! i am very happy to have this wonderful place near my home.   \n",

       "      <td>i have enjoyed sushi for a long time. my favorite was kokopelli's at circus circus. i have experiences at other places such as sushi pier, hiroba etc... however, i didn't notice this place before i received the advertised mail. i was very surprised at the wonderful sushi provided at this restaurant. for the nigiri, i cannot give them 5 stars. the amount of rice in nigiri is a little higher compared to raw fish amount. kokopelli's is the best for nigiri. however, i will give five stars to this restaurant. the rolls are the best.. the ratio of rice and contents are very good for taste. generally, the quality of raw fish is very good. the price is highly competitive in those good quality of food. their friendly service, short wait time for food, and other extras such as free beer, alcohol, and vip promotions are perfect additional benefits to their customers! i am very happy to have this wonderful place near my home.</td>\n",

       "      <td>i stopped in this particular shop rite because i work nearby and i needed to deposit a couple checks at their pnc location inside.  it turned out the pnc wasn't open yet (i work overnight shift &amp; they open and stay open a bit later than most.) i decided i would pick up just a few items- i had been looking specifically for black bean pasta as i couldn't find it at giant where i normally go.  i was pleasantly surprised to find not only did they have the pasta, but also a wide variety assortment of gluten free options like rice and quinoa pasta which i easily found.  i looked around to see if there were any sales i should take advantage of and honestly just ended up filling my cart with things i normally buy that were just amazing deals.  the staff i encountered was very friendly and helpful and i did not encounter a very long wait.  they also play fun oldies music, which is mostly irrelevant, but i enjoyed it.  overall, i am happy to report i found a new spot to hit up some great deals on fresh groceries.</td>\n",

       "5  perhaps my expectations were too high, but overall, indo would not make my top 10 go-to in st. louis.  i am comparing indo against my stl favorites louie, olive & oak, sidney street, egg, etc.  as my experience has been at polite society, things were over-prepared.  i prefer to taste the main ingredient and in both cases (indo and polite society), there seems to be too much going on that the main ingredient gets outshined.  we had 4 dishes for the 2 of us: lamb ribs (tasty but so much sweetness), tiger shrimp (again, too sweet and under-cooked toward the head), cabbage salad (overall very good but again too sweet) and the biggest disappointment of all the ribeye.  it was swimming in soy sauce-based sauce which didn't do anything for the beautiful piece of meat that was perfectly cooked.  we literally wiped each piece off the bowl of rice that came with the dish.  the 2 sauces that came with the steak, one of them was sickeningly sweet.   based on all the great reviews, my personal taste to be out of fashion, but i'd rather not suffer from thirst due to too much sugar and salt after dinner. what was impressive was their attention to detail, and impeccable and unobtrusive service.  their execution seems to be first-rate both front and back of the house just not to my taste in the flavor department.   i am planning on going back and trying the curry and sushi.  hoping for a better experience.   \n",

       "      <td>i wash my hands of this \"restaurant\". when i think back to my experience at la terraza i want to cry. waitress some how lost herself along with my order. i asked another waiter for more chips to eat (since my friend was almost done with her meal) and he said, \"find your own waitress\".. i went to say, \"i can't\", but he was already on the other side of the swinging door. also i'm pretty sure their sauce is just ketchup with a smidge of onion and cilantro.  i wish this was a joke review, i really do. i also wish i had my $14 bucks back, but nevertheless this place was horrendous. terrible service. on a side note, once i got my food (after the manager asked where it was since i'd been there for 45 minutes).... guess what?  it was awful and tasteless. i am a civil person who is generally nice to strangers and my fellow nashvillians, but it's safe to say i ain't coming back to la terraza.</td>\n",

       "      <td>i was a bit nervous coming here with a 5 year old in tow, as it definitely didn't appear to be a kid friendly restaurant. it's a tiny little apartment turned restaurant with a few tables downstairs and a few tables upstairs. not fancy, but charming and \"homey\" for sure.  it's byo, so our waitress instantly corked our wine and was friendly and efficient throughout the night. the owner came by (twice) and spoke to us for awhile. he was actually happy to see we had brought my son, who was occupied playing on the phone. although my son had his leftover pb&amp;j from the franklin institute (super picky and there wasn't anything on the menu he would've eaten), the owner didn't mind the least and made my son feel most welcome. the chef also made a point to come by in the middle of our meal. the friendliness of all who worked there is a big part of what made this an enjoyable experience.  for the food... we started with the burrata which was tasty. i had the branzino special for my meal. it was good, but i am spoiled and have hade some of the best branzino dishes in miami. i knew it would be difficult to compete with. for dessert we had the cannoli, the tiramisu, and another pastry dessert that i don't recall the name of it. i found the tiramisu to be a little too strong. the other two were delicious!  i can't say that i was totally blown away by the food (which is a rare occasion for me in general), but the attentiveness of the owner, chef, and staff made me want to visit again. also, i should have tried a pasta dish... so if i were to return, that's what i'd do!!</td>\n",

       "8  i was a bit nervous coming here with a 5 year old in tow, as it definitely didn't appear to be a kid friendly restaurant. it's a tiny little apartment turned restaurant with a few tables downstairs and a few tables upstairs. not fancy, but charming and \"homey\" for sure.  it's byo, so our waitress instantly corked our wine and was friendly and efficient throughout the night. the owner came by (twice) and spoke to us for awhile. he was actually happy to see we had brought my son, who was occupied playing on the phone. although my son had his leftover pb&j from the franklin institute (super picky and there wasn't anything on the menu he would've eaten), the owner didn't mind the least and made my son feel most welcome. the chef also made a point to come by in the middle of our meal. the friendliness of all who worked there is a big part of what made this an enjoyable experience.  for the food... we started with the burrata which was tasty. i had the branzino special for my meal. it was good, but i am spoiled and have hade some of the best branzino dishes in miami. i knew it would be difficult to compete with. for dessert we had the cannoli, the tiramisu, and another pastry dessert that i don't recall the name of it. i found the tiramisu to be a little too strong. the other two were delicious!  i can't say that i was totally blown away by the food (which is a rare occasion for me in general), but the attentiveness of the owner, chef, and staff made me want to visit again. also, i should have tried a pasta dish... so if i were to return, that's what i'd do!!   \n",

       "7   i wash my hands of this \"restaurant\". when i think back to my experience at la terraza i want to cry. waitress some how lost herself along with my order. i asked another waiter for more chips to eat (since my friend was almost done with her meal) and he said, \"find your own waitress\".. i went to say, \"i can't\", but he was already on the other side of the swinging door. also i'm pretty sure their sauce is just ketchup with a smidge of onion and cilantro.  i wish this was a joke review, i really do. i also wish i had my $14 bucks back, but nevertheless this place was horrendous. terrible service. on a side note, once i got my food (after the manager asked where it was since i'd been there for 45 minutes).... guess what?  it was awful and tasteless. i am a civil person who is generally nice to strangers and my fellow nashvillians, but it's safe to say i ain't coming back to la terraza.   \n",

       "7   i wash my hands of this \"restaurant\". when i think back to my experience at la terraza i want to cry. waitress some how lost herself along with my order. i asked another waiter for more chips to eat (since my friend was almost done with her meal) and he said, \"find your own waitress\".. i went to say, \"i can't\", but he was already on the other side of the swinging door. also i'm pretty sure their sauce is just ketchup with a smidge of onion and cilantro.  i wish this was a joke review, i really do. i also wish i had my $14 bucks back, but nevertheless this place was horrendous. terrible service. on a side note, once i got my food (after the manager asked where it was since i'd been there for 45 minutes).... guess what?  it was awful and tasteless. i am a civil person who is generally nice to strangers and my fellow nashvillians, but it's safe to say i ain't coming back to la terraza.   \n",

       "0  [possibly some of the best mexican food i have ever eaten in california  i have to thank my fellow yelpers we were driving up from la on highway 101 and decided to pull off to give this place a shot  trying to park a long bed f150 4x4 pick up made the stop a little more interesting but we made it happen after getting creative in the back parking lot behind los agaves  we came in the back door and found a walk up counter where you order your food from a menu and then are given a number to place on the table  the line was about 4 to 5 people deep but went pretty quickly  we stepped up and ordered tacos del mar we had to try the fish taco of course but also tried shrimp chicken pork and steak in addition i saw a guy with the wet burrito so i ordered a steak wet burrito to add to our lunch  like most couples we order a little bit of this and that and each get to taste several things on the menu    they gave us some chips so we wandered over to their cute little salsa bar and got some salsas for the chips and for the tacos  since we were driving it was a no on cerveza but if you are chilling they had a decent beer selectionthe food showed up about 10 minutes later the smells were amazing and the food was hot and steamy  i loved everything that i tried at los agaves  we were pretty lucky because we caught them before the big lunch rush  we watched the line get longer and longer as we ate and were grateful that we arrived when we did  i wish that we lived closer to this place than 500 miles away because this would be our go to for mexican food   next time we are strolling though santa barbara we will definitely pop in here again, we love this place excellent food prices and service great authentic tacos and food   our new favorite mexican restaurant, let us hop and skip over to the important parts walk in i really do not pay attention to the decor it is all the same cheesy crap the inside is fairly clean and the bathrooms were spotless  staff greets you right away they speak a fair amount of english your seated with menus and complimentary chips n salsa  chips and salsa besides the friendly staff the chips and salsa are the first impression chips actually tasted like corn tortillas not that waxy crap you get at some mexican restaurants salsa is where i took a star off because it was nothing special usually i put away the chips and salsa if the salsa is good this i ate some and then was done with it  food the menu describes everything and even has a section for definitions if you do not exactly know what a chalupa is i thought that was pretty helpful  they have your basics and other specials youll see at other restaurants what i noticed is the prices were good and their food specials do not end at a certain time say before dinner time they are all day long  kitchen staff churned out our order pretty quickly i ordered the taco salad and was very pleased with the generous sour cream usually they skimp because it is so costly it also had white shredded cheese and white cheese dip yummy the rest of my party was pleased with their mon night special of 3 tacos rice and beans for 60 dollars yes 60 dollars freaking dollars for all that my husbands steak burrito was large and already drenched in white cheese dip usually you have to pay 10 dollars extra if you want it topped on your burrito overall assessment  this place is an a in my book although i cannot vouch for the drinks I am trying to be good the food is top notch to where you do not even need a marg however if you ordered one I am sure it would make this place that much better maybe even make up for the dull salsa]  "

down there years ago  but on to my impression of martins comida   when walking in it was a bit confusing  front part is the kitchen and desk for ordering or paying  place is pretty dark with some really funky decorating  finally took a left into the dining room which consists of a few tables  there is an outdoor area to eat but it was not too inviting because it was a bit chilly  it is a small menu but substantial  a lot of the dishes were with mole sauce veggies chicken carne asada  either soft taco quesadillas burritos and tortas were some of the offerings  i loved the natural organic horchata  it was so good and genuine  i loved the chips with warm bean sauce   really very good  it was not very crowded so the service was pretty good  the owner martin seemed like he enjoyed his customers  there was a party of about 10 folks chatting and enjoying martins company    he seemed like a real fun kinda guy  my tacos were pretty tasty with the tart flavor of the mole  the burrito was kind of dry  it was huge took half of it home for tomorrow  will i go back  not so sure  glad i tried it though, let us hop and skip over to the important parts walk in i really do not pay attention to the decor it is all the same cheesy crap the inside is fairly clean and the bathrooms were spotless  staff greets you right away they speak a fair amount of english your seated with menus and complimentary chips n salsa  chips and salsa besides the friendly staff the chips and salsa are the first impression chips actually tasted like corn tortillas not that waxy crap you get at some mexican restaurants salsa is where i took a star off because it was nothing special usually i put away the chips and salsa if the salsa is good this i ate some and then was done with it  food the menu describes everything and even has a section for definitions if you do not exactly know what a chalupa is i thought that was pretty helpful  they have your basics and other specials youll see at other restaurants what i noticed is the prices were good and their food specials do not end at a certain time say before dinner time they are all day long  kitchen staff churned out our order pretty quickly i ordered the taco salad and was very pleased with the generous sour cream usually they skimp because it is so costly it also had white shredded cheese and white cheese dip yummy the rest of my party was pleased with their mon night special of 3 tacos rice and beans for 60 dollars yes 60 dollars freaking dollars for all that my husbands steak burrito was large and already drenched in white cheese dip usually you have to pay 10 dollars extra if you want it topped on your burrito overall assessment  this place is an a in my book although i cannot vouch for the drinks I am trying to be good the food is top notch to where you do not even need a marg however if you ordered one I am sure it would make this place that much better maybe even make up for the dull salsa, I have wanted to go to mariachis for quite a while and was excited to finally be able to go the restaurant claims it serves authentic mexican food which i love I have had the good fortune to visit mexico many times and i was hoping to get that experience closer to home unfortunately i was less than impressed the interior decor is dated and cosmetically in need of an update but I have been to enough hole in the walls to know the food is what makes the place the menu is expansive which is a plus the problem is that the food i had was not good  we were greeted immediately upon entering and sat down quickly a waitress took our drink orders right away and brought chips with salsa verde the chips were ok but the salsa verde was tasteless with the consistency of water i ordered a side of guacamole to go with the chips the guacamole was fresh and had a nice taste we ordered combo fajitas chicken chimichangas and a side of refried beans our food was served within a decent amount of time but we were not given silverware or napkins and there was no plate for the fajitas  we had to ask for all of it the fajitas were bland with no seasoning whatsoever the steak was crunchy and the peppers were mushy with an acidic aftertaste the chimichanga was ordered with mole sauce the mole sauce tasted like thick old coffee and completely covered and saturated the chimichanga the menus said it would be topped with onions and sour cream there were no onions and i had to ask for sour cream the chimichanga itself was bland lacking in seasoning and flavor i love authentic refried beans which is why i ordered them as a side they tasted as if they came from a can the consistency was off and like everything else the beans lacked in seasoning and flavor  i am really disappointed i was really hoping that this could be my new local goto for a yummy authentic mexican meal unfortunately ill need to keep looking]</td>\n",

      [i honestly would have rated this place 4 star had we not ordered the chicken quesadilla let us start with the good stuff birria tacos were 699 for two tacos i had been looking for birria tacos everywhere i was so glad to see it on their menu they were so good the soup that came on the side to dip was so flavorful i could have eaten probably 4 more tacos the street tacos were pretty decent too the cheek meat is where it is at although i will say i thought the meat could have used a little more seasoning it was a little bland without adding different salsas to it the chicken quesadilla was not it I am sorry to say the chicken were in huge chunks and they were just boiled the chicken was dry and salty there was not enough cheese in there because the chicken chunks kept falling out of the quesadilla service was very friendly and restaurant was very clean, possibly some of the best mexican food i have ever eaten in california  i have to thank my fellow yelpers we were driving up from la on highway 101 and decided to pull off to give this place a shot  trying to park a long bed f150 4x4 pick up made the stop a little more interesting but we made it happen after getting creative in the back parking lot behind los agaves  we came in the back door and found a walk up counter where you order your food from a menu and then are given a number to place on the table  the line was about 4 to 5 people deep but went pretty quickly  we stepped up and ordered tacos del mar we had to try the fish taco of course but also tried shrimp chicken pork and steak in addition i saw a guy with the wet burrito so i ordered a steak wet burrito to add to our lunch  like most couples we order a little bit of this and that and each get to taste several things on the menu    they gave us some chips so we wandered over to their cute little salsa bar and got some salsas for the chips and for the tacos  since we were driving it was a no on cerveza but if you are chilling they had a decent beer selectionthe food showed up about 10 minutes later the smells were amazing and the food was hot and steamy  i loved everything that i tried at los agaves  we were pretty lucky because we caught them before the big lunch rush  we watched the line get longer and longer as we ate and were grateful that we arrived when we did  i wish that we lived closer to this place than 500 miles away because this would be our go to for mexican food   next time we are strolling though santa barbara we will definitely pop in here again, we love this place excellent food prices and service great authentic tacos and food   our new favorite mexican restaurant]  \n",
       "1  [we have wanted to check out martins for a long time  so finally we decided this would be the day  sad to say that 4th ave seems to be on a downward slope  it used to be more lively down there years ago  but on to my impression of martins comida   when walking in it was a bit confusing  front part is the kitchen and desk for ordering or paying  place is pretty dark with some really funky decorating  finally took a left into the dining room which consists of a few tables  there is an outdoor area to eat but it was not too inviting because it was a bit chilly  it is a small menu but substantial  a lot of the dishes were with mole sauce veggies chicken carne asada  either soft taco quesadillas burritos and tortas were some of the offerings  i loved the natural organic horchata  it was so good and genuine  i loved the chips with warm bean sauce   really very good  it was not very crowded so the service was pretty good  the owner martin seemed like he enjoyed his customers  there was a party of about 10 folks chatting and enjoying martins company    he seemed like a real fun kinda guy  my tacos were pretty tasty with the tart flavor of the mole  the burrito was kind of dry  it was huge took half of it home for tomorrow  will i go back  not so sure  glad i tried it though, let us hop and skip over to the important parts walk in i really do not pay attention to the decor it is all the same cheesy crap the inside is fairly clean and the bathrooms were spotless  staff greets you right away they speak a fair amount of english your seated with menus and complimentary chips n salsa  chips and salsa besides the friendly staff the chips and salsa are the first impression chips actually tasted like corn tortillas not that waxy crap you get at some mexican restaurants salsa is where i took a star off because it was nothing special usually i put away the chips and salsa if the salsa is good this i ate some and then was done with it  food the menu describes everything and even has a section for definitions if you do not exactly know what a chalupa is i thought that was pretty helpful  they have your basics and other specials youll see at other restaurants what i noticed is the prices were good and their food specials do not end at a certain time say before dinner time they are all day long  kitchen staff churned out our order pretty quickly i ordered the taco salad and was very pleased with the generous sour cream usually they skimp because it is so costly it also had white shredded cheese and white cheese dip yummy the rest of my party was pleased with their mon night special of 3 tacos rice and beans for 60 dollars yes 60 dollars freaking dollars for all that my husbands steak burrito was large and already drenched in white cheese dip usually you have to pay 10 dollars extra if you want it topped on your burrito overall assessment  this place is an a in my book although i cannot vouch for the drinks I am trying to be good the food is top notch to where you do not even need a marg however if you ordered one I am sure it would make this place that much better maybe even make up for the dull salsa, I have wanted to go to mariachis for quite a while and was excited to finally be able to go the restaurant claims it serves authentic mexican food which i love I have had the good fortune to visit mexico many times and i was hoping to get that experience closer to home unfortunately i was less than impressed the interior decor is dated and cosmetically in need of an update but I have been to enough hole in the walls to know the food is what makes the place the menu is expansive which is a plus the problem is that the food i had was not good  we were greeted immediately upon entering and sat down quickly a waitress took our drink orders right away and brought chips with salsa verde the chips were ok but the salsa verde was tasteless with the consistency of water i ordered a side of guacamole to go with the chips the guacamole was fresh and had a nice taste we ordered combo fajitas chicken chimichangas and a side of refried beans our food was served within a decent amount of time but we were not given silverware or napkins and there was no plate for the fajitas  we had to ask for all of it the fajitas were bland with no seasoning whatsoever the steak was crunchy and the peppers were mushy with an acidic aftertaste the chimichanga was ordered with mole sauce the mole sauce tasted like thick old coffee and completely covered and saturated the chimichanga the menus said it would be topped with onions and sour cream there were no onions and i had to ask for sour cream the chimichanga itself was bland lacking in seasoning and flavor i love authentic refried beans which is why i ordered them as a side they tasted as if they came from a can the consistency was off and like everything else the beans lacked in seasoning and flavor  i am really disappointed i was really hoping that this could be my new local goto for a yummy authentic mexican meal unfortunately ill need to keep looking]  \n",

fresh and delicious this is our new goto mexican restaurant they are above all others around here check them out, authentic mexican food dirt cheap i love this place it is not tex mex or americanized mexican food it is legit mexican I am usually the only white person in the place when i come in and the staff only sortof speaks english that is how you know it is good everything here is amazing chicken burrito salted beef homemade chips and salsa holy hell i love it it is super casual and there is not anything fancy about it but the food is excellent eat here you will love it, travel post coming from san diego we have very high standards for mexican cuisine i had been scouring yelp to find a spot that would wow me and my family this place did not disappoint we really enjoyed the fast casual but clean ambiance the part that we really enjoyed about this spot was how incredibly fresh each dish was i ordered the tacos del mar and it was light and flavorful the veggie enchiladas with the green sauce has a very pleasant tangy flavor the chile relleno was super crispy with a really fresh red sauce the tacos al pastor was had a deep smokey spicy flavor with a great pineapple relish that complimented the tacos very nicely but the agaves enchiladas was something that greatly surprised us the orange cream sauce went so well with the seafood inside the enchiladas all the salsas at the salsa bar was also so delicious  if you come here i highly recommend the tacos al pastor and the agaves enchiladas the word we left here with was incredible thank you los agaves for an incredible meal my family and i appreciated the meal so much]  "

       "3  i wash my hands of this \"restaurant\". when i think back to my experience at la terraza i want to cry. waitress some how lost herself along with my order. i asked another waiter for more chips to eat (since my friend was almost done with her meal) and he said, \"find your own waitress\".. i went to say, \"i can't\", but he was already on the other side of the swinging door. also i'm pretty sure their sauce is just ketchup with a smidge of onion and cilantro.  i wish this was a joke review, i really do. i also wish i had my $14 bucks back, but nevertheless this place was horrendous. terrible service. on a side note, once i got my food (after the manager asked where it was since i'd been there for 45 minutes).... guess what?  it was awful and tasteless. i am a civil person who is generally nice to strangers and my fellow nashvillians, but it's safe to say i ain't coming back to la terraza.   \n",

       "3  i wash my hands of this \"restaurant\". when i think back to my experience at la terraza i want to cry. waitress some how lost herself along with my order. i asked another waiter for more chips to eat (since my friend was almost done with her meal) and he said, \"find your own waitress\".. i went to say, \"i can't\", but he was already on the other side of the swinging door. also i'm pretty sure their sauce is just ketchup with a smidge of onion and cilantro.  i wish this was a joke review, i really do. i also wish i had my $14 bucks back, but nevertheless this place was horrendous. terrible service. on a side note, once i got my food (after the manager asked where it was since i'd been there for 45 minutes).... guess what?  it was awful and tasteless. i am a civil person who is generally nice to strangers and my fellow nashvillians, but it's safe to say i ain't coming back to la terraza.   \n",
