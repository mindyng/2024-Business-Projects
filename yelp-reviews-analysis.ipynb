The female cashier was very friendly (flirtatious!) and the pastries shown in nicely adorned display cases. I stopped by early one evening had a sesame ball, which was filled with bean paste. The glutinous rice of the ball was nicely flavored, similar to Bai Tang Gao. Definitely as place worth stopping at if you are in the area.   \n",

They have a decent variety of buns and pastries.  Red bean-filled buns, mung bean-filled buns, coconut stuff, egg tarts etc.  If you buy a dozen, they will give you two more for free.  The prices are standard for a Chinese bakery, with most things at approximately $1.  The service has always been good.  They do serve coffee and tea.  There are a couple of tables inside, with usually the expected group of older Chinese guys chillin' in the corner table debating about something.  Great place to stock up on the buns, which I usually do before leaving town.   \n",

The female cashier was very friendly (flirtatious!) and the pastries shown in nicely adorned display cases. I stopped by early one evening had a sesame ball, which was filled with bean paste. The glutinous rice of the ball was nicely flavored, similar to Bai Tang Gao. Definitely as place worth stopping at if you are in the area.  \n",

They have a decent variety of buns and pastries.  Red bean-filled buns, mung bean-filled buns, coconut stuff, egg tarts etc.  If you buy a dozen, they will give you two more for free.  The prices are standard for a Chinese bakery, with most things at approximately $1.  The service has always been good.  They do serve coffee and tea.  There are a couple of tables inside, with usually the expected group of older Chinese guys chillin' in the corner table debating about something.  Great place to stock up on the buns, which I usually do before leaving town.  \n",

       "4        HK-STYLE MILK TEA:  FOUR STARS\\n\\nNot quite sure why there are two Saint Honore Pastries business listings on Yelp, but I have been checking in to this one.\\n\\nBoyfriend and I go by it all the time while in Chinatown, but it never crossed our mind to try it.  I think we might have tried it once a year or two ago, but it wasn't memorable.  I decided to try the HK-style milk tea not too long ago and was hooked.  I think I went here almost every day one week to get the milk tea, only to realize that I should REALLY watch my sugar intake...it's sooo good!  \\n\\nI personally don't think it's better than Zhong Gang's HK-style milk tea because they have their off days when a certain lady makes them (not enough ice, too much ice, etc.).\\n\\nOn a side note:  I wanted to try the crispy roast pork bun, but accidentally said the wrong name in Chinese and got the roast pork bun.  It was decent enough, although I will get to trying the crispy roast pork bun soon!  \\n\\nI will be back~  \n",

The prices are affordable, the portions are generous, the staff is friendly, and the food is AMAZING. \\n\\nThe last time I went to the Plum Pit, I ordered a jerk chicken sandwich to split with a friend. Learn from our mistake--order your own sandwich, and if you can't finish it, save half for later. We ended up going back for another sandwich (the one with chicken tenders, mac & cheese, and bacon--I can't remember the name) anyway. We also got two orders of bread pudding to bring home, which, though pretty good cold, is ever better when you heat it up in the oven for 10-15 minutes.  \n",

This food was really good! We all got one of almost everything and tasted it. We were so surprised.  The portion size was on point! Chef Floyd and T (Angie was her name on the contract) did a great job executing the orders in the heat. They made a great team. They worked very well together and had a great sense of humor. The next time I'm in the area, I will definitely look them up. If you are having an event and are in or around the Media, Pennsylvania area you should definitely look them up and have their food truck at your next event!  \n",

My rating is the size of the items vs price. This was the BLT I got for $6.95, (just the sandwich, no fries or chips). Bread was grilled, not toasted. The slice of chocolate cake for $3.95 was small and tasted stale according to my fiance. The Greek nachos were very good as was the pepperoni inside out. \\n\\nWe may think twice before ordering again.   \n",

I was pleasantly surprised to realize you can order anything off the menu, NOT just breakfast food, so at 6:15am, I opted for a soda and Chicago dog...yippee!!! A breakfast for champions!\\n\\nI really don't eat at Sonic except for 1/2 price drinks at happy hour from 2-4pm every day and before 10am. I like to take advantage of the large drinks for a little over a $1...call me a scrooge or money miser, but IF I CAN SAVE I will SAVE!!! Everyone is like that!   \n",

While i order my wraps with double-chicken, the $11+ prices is the only thing holding this back from 5 stars.  \\n\\nThe popeye's trail-mix wrap or the Food Pyramid wrap are my favorite.  In addition, they always have great looking pizza's and the soups are never your typical boring chicken-noodle.  The parking is terrible (watch out for the Philly Parking Authority) I was ding'd for a $52 ticket while being inside for under 2 mins.\\n\\nIt's a gem hidden in a town of hipsters and drunks.   \n",

I'm not good at waiting in line for casual dining especially when there are several places close by to grab a bite to eat. After finally getting to eat there I do understand why they stay consistently busy. Probably some of the best Tex-Mex I've had in the area and I will return in the near future.\\nA smaller seating area than you might think gives VIP a cozy atmosphere, prices seem value driven my favorite margaritas are down the street though on St. Pete Beach   \n",

Some of the same employees here everytime we come.   Quick, neighborhood, super casual spot.  Great meals combos like the Dine In Special and the Pizza & Salad Special. Makes great left overs warmed up in the oven or just eaten cold.  This location seems better than most.   \n",

I love the different dining experiences we are seeing lately from some of these cool restaurants. \\n\\nThey serve your steak at the table beginning to cook on a 755 degree square black slab of granite. We each ordered a filet. Which came out perfectly trimmed and a high quality of beef. \\n\\nThe server we had (Bailey) was very friendly, and helpful . \\n\\nAll of the other food items we ordered were very good. \\n\\nThe price was fair. For the atmosphere, the unique style of serving food, and the quality of the food I expected a higher price.   \n",

I was pleasantly surprised to realize you can order anything off the menu, NOT just breakfast food, so at 6:15am, I opted for a soda and Chicago dog...yippee!!! A breakfast for champions! I really don't eat at Sonic except for 1/2 price drinks at happy hour from 2-4pm every day and before 10am. I like to take advantage of the large drinks for a little over a $1...call me a scrooge or money miser, but IF I CAN SAVE I will SAVE!!! Everyone is like that!  \n",

While i order my wraps with double-chicken, the $11+ prices is the only thing holding this back from 5 stars.   The popeye's trail-mix wrap or the Food Pyramid wrap are my favorite.  In addition, they always have great looking pizza's and the soups are never your typical boring chicken-noodle.  The parking is terrible (watch out for the Philly Parking Authority) I was ding'd for a $52 ticket while being inside for under 2 mins. It's a gem hidden in a town of hipsters and drunks.  \n",

I'm not good at waiting in line for casual dining especially when there are several places close by to grab a bite to eat. After finally getting to eat there I do understand why they stay consistently busy. Probably some of the best Tex-Mex I've had in the area and I will return in the near future.A smaller seating area than you might think gives VIP a cozy atmosphere, prices seem value driven my favorite margaritas are down the street though on St. Pete Beach  \n",

Some of the same employees here everytime we come.   Quick, neighborhood, super casual spot.  Great meals combos like the Dine In Special and the Pizza & Salad Special.

I love the different dining experiences we are seeing lately from some of these cool restaurants.  They serve your steak at the table beginning to cook on a 755 degree square black slab of granite. We each ordered a filet. Which came out perfectly trimmed and a high quality of beef.  The server we had (Bailey) was very friendly, and helpful .  All of the other food items we ordered were very good.  The price was fair. For the atmosphere, the unique style of serving food, and the quality of the food I expected a higher price.  \n",

       "3679406  I had high hopes for Cafe La Maude, but sadly it didn't quite live up to my expectations. Tucked away in Fishtown, this spot has all the makings for a hidden gem. The creative appropriately themed decor makes for a unique dining experience and quaint atmosphere. The tables felt a bit too cramped though, and we wound up feeling incredibly rushed throughout the meal due the staff who seemed to be waiting to clear the table as soon as we took our last bite. The Gypsy Eggs were packed with flavor but the breaded eggplant feel short and the dish's portion size was in no way worthy of the $18 sticker price. Unfortunately, a disappointing dining experience overall.   \n",

       "4999  this is my new favorite stop in tampa!  so you get to the place and it has a great colorful awning that you just cant miss - especially at night. the inside is large like it used to be a chinese buffet. i wanted something other than the pho or bun i usually go for so i decide on the squid stuffed with pork. i know right?  it was a fantastic dish!  the squid and the pork were good and if they were just by themselves it would be a 3 star dish. the brown sauce that they are cooked in though?  on point!  it was a thick brown sauce with the sweetness of hoisin but it wasn't overly sweet.  eaten together with the lettuce, cucumber and tomato for crunch and fresh flavors it was a fantastic dish. be warned that the pork is like the meatballs in the pho so it's not strips of pork.  some people may balk at it but definitely stray from your pho and try it out. i'm going for the curried frog legs next time. bon apetit.   \n",

       "4999  this is my new favorite stop in tampa!  so you get to the place and it has a great colorful awning that you just cant miss - especially at night. the inside is large like it used to be a chinese buffet. i wanted something other than the pho or bun i usually go for so i decide on the squid stuffed with pork. i know right?  it was a fantastic dish!  the squid and the pork were good and if they were just by themselves it would be a 3 star dish. the brown sauce that they are cooked in though?  on point!  it was a thick brown sauce with the sweetness of hoisin but it wasn't overly sweet.  eaten together with the lettuce, cucumber and tomato for crunch and fresh flavors it was a fantastic dish. be warned that the pork is like the meatballs in the pho so it's not strips of pork.  some people may balk at it but definitely stray from your pho and try it out. i'm going for the curried frog legs next time. bon apetit.   \n",

       "5  there's a good reason why obama loves pi... it is beyond delicious. i get a warm fuzzy feeling just thinking about it. my first pi trip was after a particularly long and trying sunday at work. let me tell you, if you ever have a crappy day, just go have dinner at pi, it'll fix you right up. we're talking heaven here people.  first off, order some wine. pi's selection of organic wines is awesome, and if you're not sure which direction to go, just ask your waiter, they can usually point you in a good direction. mmmmm red wine and pizza.  next step for me is always garlic bread (initially selected because it was the cheapest starter on the menu, not gonna lie). this is not your typical garlic bread. they bring you out a loaf of warm bread, accompanied by creamy, melty butter and a roasted garlic clove. it has forever changed the way i look at garlic bread. so good.  now the pizza. i know this is st. louis, but dammit people, order the deep dish! while i know plenty of people who love the thin crust here, its just not my favorite, and i feel like if you're here, you need to go big or go home. the south side classico is my hands down favorite. pair it with some red wine and you will seriously not care about anything else in the world. this pizza is the perfect combination of crunchy, gooey, savory amazingness. mmmmm :o) add to the food the awesome decor and amazing servers and this place pretty much rocks. my only complaint would be that it does get pretty loud, especially when it's packed, but in a way that kind of just adds to the atmosphere. just maybe don't bring grandma if she's hard of hearing (you can always take her leftovers!)   \n",

       "8  had to stop into an alternate business across the road on a saturday morning (1 aug 2020)  and had to hit a breakfast joint up - los betos was the spot!  first thing that i want to recognize is the incredible timeline this place is open: mon-sat 0430-1000 pm!? then sunday from 0700-0600 pm. really going the distance here to make the availability to be open so for that, i'm quite impressed! second, the food is hot, fresh, delicious and fast! really gotta shout out that this food is delish. had a 'supreme' burrito and it was finger-licking darn delish!! drinks are not self serve through covid-19 at the moment but a large drink only costs you $2.00 seating is situated so you're about 6 feet apart as well. and, a popular mexican cable music channel is broadcasted on a little 32\" tv hanging on the wall. the store wasn't messy or smelly, but the look of it was a bit rough and weathered. half the lights didn't illuminate, can't discern if the surfaces where sanitized and the overall look was again, just rough. please don't look down too much on that but it is note worthy. personally, my family and i love dives per se; you can normally find some of the most humble restaurants and even better food.  gripe time. not a fan of restaurants shutting down restrooms for 'covid'. there just isn't enough speaking power to present a convincing stance to me that this needs to be done. it restricts people under emergencies and with medical issues alongside with making the whole experience just better so you can wash your hands afterwards (or before for sanitation!) i'm not a fan of businesses that do this and they do here... overall, delicious food and grateful they're open and if you're in a hurry, the drive-through rocks too!!   \n",

       "8   had to stop into an alternate business across the road on a saturday morning 1 aug 2020  and had to hit a breakfast joint up  los betos was the spot  first thing that i want to recognize is the incredible timeline this place is open monsat 04301000 pm then sunday from 07000600 pm really going the distance here to make the availability to be open so for that I am quite impressed second the food is hot fresh delicious and fast really gotta shout out that this food is delish had a supreme burrito and it was fingerlicking darn delish drinks are not self serve through covid19 at the moment but a large drink only costs you 20 dollars seating is situated so you are about 6 feet apart as well and a popular mexican cable music channel is broadcasted on a little 32 tv hanging on the wall the store was not messy or smelly but the look of it was a bit rough and weathered half the lights did not illuminate cannot discern if the surfaces where sanitized and the overall look was again just rough please do not look down too much on that but it is note worthy personally my family and i love dives per se you can normally find some of the most humble restaurants and even better food  gripe time not a fan of restaurants shutting down restrooms for covid there just is not enough speaking power to present a convincing stance to me that this needs to be done it restricts people under emergencies and with medical issues alongside with making the whole experience just better so you can wash your hands afterwards or before for sanitation I am not a fan of businesses that do this and they do here overall delicious food and grateful they are open and if you are in a hurry the drivethrough rocks too   \n",

       "8   had to stop into an alternate business across the road on a saturday morning (1 aug 2020)  and had to hit a breakfast joint up - los betos was the spot!  first thing that i want to recognize is the incredible timeline this place is open: mon-sat 0430-1000 pm!? then sunday from 0700-0600 pm. really going the distance here to make the availability to be open so for that, i'm quite impressed! second, the food is hot, fresh, delicious and fast! really gotta shout out that this food is delish. had a 'supreme' burrito and it was finger-licking darn delish!! drinks are not self serve through covid-19 at the moment but a large drink only costs you $2.00 seating is situated so you're about 6 feet apart as well. and, a popular mexican cable music channel is broadcasted on a little 32\" tv hanging on the wall. the store wasn't messy or smelly, but the look of it was a bit rough and weathered. half the lights didn't illuminate, can't discern if the surfaces where sanitized and the overall look was again, just rough. please don't look down too much on that but it is note worthy. personally, my family and i love dives per se; you can normally find some of the most humble restaurants and even better food.  gripe time. not a fan of restaurants shutting down restrooms for 'covid'. there just isn't enough speaking power to present a convincing stance to me that this needs to be done. it restricts people under emergencies and with medical issues alongside with making the whole experience just better so you can wash your hands afterwards (or before for sanitation!) i'm not a fan of businesses that do this and they do here... overall, delicious food and grateful they're open and if you're in a hurry, the drive-through rocks too!!   \n",

       "8   had to stop into an alternate business across the road on a saturday morning 1 aug 2020  and had to hit a breakfast joint up  los betos was the spot  first thing that i want to recognize is the incredible timeline this place is open monsat 04301000 pm then sunday from 07000600 pm really going the distance here to make the availability to be open so for that I am quite impressed second the food is hot fresh delicious and fast really gotta shout out that this food is delish had a supreme burrito and it was fingerlicking darn delish drinks are not self serve through covid19 at the moment but a large drink only costs you 20 dollars seating is situated so you are about 6 feet apart as well and a popular mexican cable music channel is broadcasted on a little 32 tv hanging on the wall the store was not messy or smelly but the look of it was a bit rough and weathered half the lights did not illuminate cannot discern if the surfaces where sanitized and the overall look was again just rough please do not look down too much on that but it is note worthy personally my family and i love dives per se you can normally find some of the most humble restaurants and even better food  gripe time not a fan of restaurants shutting down restrooms for covid there just is not enough speaking power to present a convincing stance to me that this needs to be done it restricts people under emergencies and with medical issues alongside with making the whole experience just better so you can wash your hands afterwards or before for sanitation I am not a fan of businesses that do this and they do here overall delicious food and grateful they are open and if you are in a hurry the drivethrough rocks too   \n",

       "8   had to stop into an alternate business across the road on a saturday morning (1 aug 2020)  and had to hit a breakfast joint up - los betos was the spot!  first thing that i want to recognize is the incredible timeline this place is open: mon-sat 0430-1000 pm!? then sunday from 0700-0600 pm. really going the distance here to make the availability to be open so for that, i'm quite impressed! second, the food is hot, fresh, delicious and fast! really gotta shout out that this food is delish. had a 'supreme' burrito and it was finger-licking darn delish!! drinks are not self serve through covid-19 at the moment but a large drink only costs you $2.00 seating is situated so you're about 6 feet apart as well. and, a popular mexican cable music channel is broadcasted on a little 32\" tv hanging on the wall. the store wasn't messy or smelly, but the look of it was a bit rough and weathered. half the lights didn't illuminate, can't discern if the surfaces where sanitized and the overall look was again, just rough. please don't look down too much on that but it is note worthy. personally, my family and i love dives per se; you can normally find some of the most humble restaurants and even better food.  gripe time. not a fan of restaurants shutting down restrooms for 'covid'. there just isn't enough speaking power to present a convincing stance to me that this needs to be done. it restricts people under emergencies and with medical issues alongside with making the whole experience just better so you can wash your hands afterwards (or before for sanitation!) i'm not a fan of businesses that do this and they do here... overall, delicious food and grateful they're open and if you're in a hurry, the drive-through rocks too!!   \n",

       "8   had to stop into an alternate business across the road on a saturday morning 1 aug 2020  and had to hit a breakfast joint up  los betos was the spot  first thing that i want to recognize is the incredible timeline this place is open monsat 04301000 pm then sunday from 07000600 pm really going the distance here to make the availability to be open so for that I am quite impressed second the food is hot fresh delicious and fast really gotta shout out that this food is delish had a supreme burrito and it was fingerlicking darn delish drinks are not self serve through covid19 at the moment but a large drink only costs you 20 dollars seating is situated so you are about 6 feet apart as well and a popular mexican cable music channel is broadcasted on a little 32 tv hanging on the wall the store was not messy or smelly but the look of it was a bit rough and weathered half the lights did not illuminate cannot discern if the surfaces where sanitized and the overall look was again just rough please do not look down too much on that but it is note worthy personally my family and i love dives per se you can normally find some of the most humble restaurants and even better food  gripe time not a fan of restaurants shutting down restrooms for covid there just is not enough speaking power to present a convincing stance to me that this needs to be done it restricts people under emergencies and with medical issues alongside with making the whole experience just better so you can wash your hands afterwards or before for sanitation I am not a fan of businesses that do this and they do here overall delicious food and grateful they are open and if you are in a hurry the drivethrough rocks too   \n",

       "8   had to stop into an alternate business across the road on a saturday morning (1 aug 2020)  and had to hit a breakfast joint up - los betos was the spot!  first thing that i want to recognize is the incredible timeline this place is open: mon-sat 0430-1000 pm!? then sunday from 0700-0600 pm. really going the distance here to make the availability to be open so for that, i'm quite impressed! second, the food is hot, fresh, delicious and fast! really gotta shout out that this food is delish. had a 'supreme' burrito and it was finger-licking darn delish!! drinks are not self serve through covid-19 at the moment but a large drink only costs you $2.00 seating is situated so you're about 6 feet apart as well. and, a popular mexican cable music channel is broadcasted on a little 32\" tv hanging on the wall. the store wasn't messy or smelly, but the look of it was a bit rough and weathered. half the lights didn't illuminate, can't discern if the surfaces where sanitized and the overall look was again, just rough. please don't look down too much on that but it is note worthy. personally, my family and i love dives per se; you can normally find some of the most humble restaurants and even better food.  gripe time. not a fan of restaurants shutting down restrooms for 'covid'. there just isn't enough speaking power to present a convincing stance to me that this needs to be done. it restricts people under emergencies and with medical issues alongside with making the whole experience just better so you can wash your hands afterwards (or before for sanitation!) i'm not a fan of businesses that do this and they do here... overall, delicious food and grateful they're open and if you're in a hurry, the drive-through rocks too!!   \n",

       "8   had to stop into an alternate business across the road on a saturday morning 1 aug 2020  and had to hit a breakfast joint up  los betos was the spot  first thing that i want to recognize is the incredible timeline this place is open monsat 04301000 pm then sunday from 07000600 pm really going the distance here to make the availability to be open so for that I am quite impressed second the food is hot fresh delicious and fast really gotta shout out that this food is delish had a supreme burrito and it was fingerlicking darn delish drinks are not self serve through covid19 at the moment but a large drink only costs you 20 dollars seating is situated so you are about 6 feet apart as well and a popular mexican cable music channel is broadcasted on a little 32 tv hanging on the wall the store was not messy or smelly but the look of it was a bit rough and weathered half the lights did not illuminate cannot discern if the surfaces where sanitized and the overall look was again just rough please do not look down too much on that but it is note worthy personally my family and i love dives per se you can normally find some of the most humble restaurants and even better food  gripe time not a fan of restaurants shutting down restrooms for covid there just is not enough speaking power to present a convincing stance to me that this needs to be done it restricts people under emergencies and with medical issues alongside with making the whole experience just better so you can wash your hands afterwards or before for sanitation I am not a fan of businesses that do this and they do here overall delicious food and grateful they are open and if you are in a hurry the drivethrough rocks too   \n",

       "      <td>[I am a big fan of mexican food I have really any type or region someone i know  suggested this place i was eager to go because I have never been and I am always wanting to try new places the inside is awesome it is very colorful with a lot of carved furniture and wall pieces the staff is awesome very attentive without being overbearing to start we got chips and salsa the chips were awesome they were crunchy and not super greasy which is a thing for me we also got a side of queso of course it it was spring break i had to get a frozen watermelon margarita which was very tasty and then for my lunch i got three enchiladas chicken beef and cheese with a salad on top my food was very delicious hot season well and not soggy ill definitely be back to try some more awesome food and drinks awesome place in bg, another great taco place near usf the menu is easy to read and if you have any questions the employees are very helpful in answering them i wanted to try everything but had to control myself so i went for a tostada and and three tacos  the service is super fast as soon as we sat down we were already given our waters and within 5 minutes our food followed both dishes came out extremely fresh and hot the tostadas ingredients were layered together to create a perfect bite the beans cheese and vegetables complimented each other so well with the crispy base the tacos were not as impressive but they were still yummy i was not a big fan of the corn tortillas because it was kind of bland and chewy the carne asada meat was flavorful but the lengua beef tongue had an irongamey taste unlike most other mexican places the sauces that are given on the table were really flavorful the red sauce had a smokey peppery taste while the green one extremely hot had a citrusjalapeño like mixture  the restaurant is very clean has plenty of seating and i definitely will be back to try the other menu items, tonight was our first time here  i had received a gift certificate otherwise we would have never known about this restaurant  first off the salsa for the chips is the best we have had in tucson i ordered a prickly pear margarita and it was delicious  for dinner i had the chicken enchiladas beans and rice  i ordered one enchilada with the green chili and one with the red sauce and liked the green chili one a little bit better  my husband ordered the chicken fajitas with flour tortillas which are made in house he said they were really good for dessert we had the churros and it was the perfect way to end a delicious meal  as my husband said we have found a new mexican food restaurant to take family and friends too we are definitely looking forward to coming back]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[i feel like I am going to get some hate for this review but i have to be completely honest i came to el guero canelo with super high expectations this is supposed to be the place for the best worldfamous sonoran dogs according to multiple websites maybe i should have listened to the locals i met the night before this particular location was having system issues on the day i visited so there was a longer than usual wait i do not mind waiting especially when I am getting the best of the best but what i got was so far south of what i imagined first off there was very little jalapeño sauce and mayo and what there was under the pile of tomatoes not generously over the top as advertised my bun was also very soggy i ended up tearing away a good portion of it the hot dog was okay not bad but nothing outstanding either this was my very first sonoran dog and unfortunately i was very disappointed in this southern arizona staple  i also ordered a serving of arroz con lèche which to my dismay was just a cup of prepackaged storebought crap no where was it advertised that this is the case so i expected housemade rice pudding el guero canelo almost claims to have the best carne asada so I am going to give the one more try next time I am in tucson i hope to update my review with three more welldeserved stars, went here for the first time for dinner today friday evening with my wife and two kids wait time was about 20 min for seating  not bad for this area butthen the real wait began it took nearly 10 min for our waiter to come by for our drink order then after taking our dinner order it took about 50 min for our meal to arrive my son ordered tamales to try for his first time ever after 3040 min our waiter came by to tell us they ran out of tamales when my daughters hot dog arrived she is not adventurous it was supposed to come with rice and beans  they  forgot the rice  the food was pretty good chips and salsa were pretty standard fare  nothing special entrees were good but based on service time I am not sure well be back too bad as it is a good location nearby and could have been a nice addition to our rotation of family eateries, i do not like to write these because i do not think they are fair to the business owner but my last three visits here have all been lackluster i have been here many times and the food is actually very good but was served a large pitcher of margaritas and we went outside to drink them five minutes later we were told they were closed and we had to leave and could not finish the pitcher i asked why they sold it to me knowing they were going to close but got no answer my next visit there was food all over the floor after a busy day and the bathrooms were dirty we ordered food and drinks and before we got our food they began to put chairs upside down on tables and clean the place it was an hour before they closed my last visit we got seated and there was so much dropped food on the floor we asked for another booth but it was the same mens room was dirty again half way through our meal and an hour and ten minutes before they close they started cleaning the restaurant around us again we asked them to stop while we were eating and they didi think the food here is excellent and the fenton area certainly needs a place to get a meal and a drink after dark the whole town shuts down at dark maybe  they could do a little cleaning the whole time they are open]</td>\n",

       "0  [the 25 stars made me a little concerned about coming here   but my wife and i were mexicans in another lifetime  we were hungry and codys was packed with a half hour wait  we were far from our home base so i whipped out my trusty yelp app it told me this place was just down the road but the reviews were not encouraging   but we came anyway  we ordered the house guacamole and a side of refried beans like we usually do in mexican restaurants to accompany the chips and salsa  the house guac was awesome   check out my picture   it was more an avocado salad than guacamole  the avocado was cut in pieces not smashed  and i loved every bite  the refried beans were tasty  we ordered them without cheese because that is how we roll  we were feeling adventurous and there was an ad for la parrillada on the bottom of the menu  it is like fajitas on steroids with steak chicken shrimp and chorizo   it was outstanding  all the meats were mixed together and the chorizo gave this plate a very zesty kick  you gotta try it  service was good  my diet coke was always filled food came out fast and with good presentation  i cannot speak to what the other reviewers experienced and this is just my experience this one time    all i can say is that i enjoyed the experience the food was good and even though this is out of my way I am coming back  i cannot pay a restaurant a higher compliment  ymmv, the only reason they are getting 3 stars is for the happy hour which is fantastic and their patio which is a great place to be in the summer time I would highly recommend them for happy hour theyve got tvs behind the bar a large drink selection and delicious appetizers  for dinner i honestly cannot understand the pricing for mexican food they are extremely over priced granted the food is good but 200 dollars for chicken enchiladas come on again it is good and if you do not know better you might think it is worth it but it is definitely not I have had better food for half the price i think part of the justification on their part is the ingredients that they use  to me not noticeable enough difference to charge a premium  i ate with a large party and the service was pretty good they were attentive the chef came out to ask us how everything was and we were able to split our check among 5 couples at our table with no issue which is greatly appreciated  if for some reason you want fancy mexican food check it out otherwise you are probably better served looking elsewhere and saving some money, met friends for dinner  though the food was excellent and the portions were large the service was sub par  having never been there we did not know we had to order at counter and sat there waiting and waiting   we were the only customers in the establishment for dinner  there were at least two employees behind the counter 10 feet away and never said anything or offered glasses for the wine we brought   after waiting 20 minutes we went to the counter and asked if we could see menus and  or order  the person at the counter was on a cell phone the entire time we were there  after looking at the menus and going back up to order the food was served quickly in paper trays  other than bringing the food to the table there was absolutely no customer service  the food was authentic and delicious but heavy  portions were large and we all left full  a little more expensive than expected especially having no table service paper take out trays for plates plastic utensils condiments salsa sour cream in plastic capped cups and only plastic cups for  wine for a byob   prices cheap if just getting main dish but adds up if get appetizers although food is pretty good you would not be missing any atmosphere or service if you were order and take out the food and enjoy it at home  i understand a small business trying to save money with all plastic and paper but if felt more like a strictly take out place   it was very clean worth a visit for the food just do not expect any atmosphere or warmth  it felt like they could care less if we were there]  \n",

       "0  [the 25 stars made me a little concerned about coming here   but my wife and i were mexicans in another lifetime  we were hungry and codys was packed with a half hour wait  we were far from our home base so i whipped out my trusty yelp app it told me this place was just down the road but the reviews were not encouraging   but we came anyway  we ordered the house guacamole and a side of refried beans like we usually do in mexican restaurants to accompany the chips and salsa  the house guac was awesome   check out my picture   it was more an avocado salad than guacamole  the avocado was cut in pieces not smashed  and i loved every bite  the refried beans were tasty  we ordered them without cheese because that is how we roll  we were feeling adventurous and there was an ad for la parrillada on the bottom of the menu  it is like fajitas on steroids with steak chicken shrimp and chorizo   it was outstanding  all the meats were mixed together and the chorizo gave this plate a very zesty kick  you gotta try it  service was good  my diet coke was always filled food came out fast and with good presentation  i cannot speak to what the other reviewers experienced and this is just my experience this one time    all i can say is that i enjoyed the experience the food was good and even though this is out of my way I am coming back  i cannot pay a restaurant a higher compliment  ymmv, met friends for dinner  though the food was excellent and the portions were large the service was sub par  having never been there we did not know we had to order at counter and sat there waiting and waiting   we were the only customers in the establishment for dinner  there were at least two employees behind the counter 10 feet away and never said anything or offered glasses for the wine we brought   after waiting 20 minutes we went to the counter and asked if we could see menus and  or order  the person at the counter was on a cell phone the entire time we were there  after looking at the menus and going back up to order the food was served quickly in paper trays  other than bringing the food to the table there was absolutely no customer service  the food was authentic and delicious but heavy  portions were large and we all left full  a little more expensive than expected especially having no table service paper take out trays for plates plastic utensils condiments salsa sour cream in plastic capped cups and only plastic cups for  wine for a byob   prices cheap if just getting main dish but adds up if get appetizers although food is pretty good you would not be missing any atmosphere or service if you were order and take out the food and enjoy it at home  i understand a small business trying to save money with all plastic and paper but if felt more like a strictly take out place   it was very clean worth a visit for the food just do not expect any atmosphere or warmth  it felt like they could care less if we were there, the only reason they are getting 3 stars is for the happy hour which is fantastic and their patio which is a great place to be in the summer time I would highly recommend them for happy hour theyve got tvs behind the bar a large drink selection and delicious appetizers  for dinner i honestly cannot understand the pricing for mexican food they are extremely over priced granted the food is good but 200 dollars for chicken enchiladas come on again it is good and if you do not know better you might think it is worth it but it is definitely not I have had better food for half the price i think part of the justification on their part is the ingredients that they use  to me not noticeable enough difference to charge a premium  i ate with a large party and the service was pretty good they were attentive the chef came out to ask us how everything was and we were able to split our check among 5 couples at our table with no issue which is greatly appreciated  if for some reason you want fancy mexican food check it out otherwise you are probably better served looking elsewhere and saving some money]  "

       "8   had to stop into an alternate business across the road on a saturday morning (1 aug 2020)  and had to hit a breakfast joint up - los betos was the spot!  first thing that i want to recognize is the incredible timeline this place is open: mon-sat 0430-1000 pm!? then sunday from 0700-0600 pm. really going the distance here to make the availability to be open so for that, i'm quite impressed! second, the food is hot, fresh, delicious and fast! really gotta shout out that this food is delish. had a 'supreme' burrito and it was finger-licking darn delish!! drinks are not self serve through covid-19 at the moment but a large drink only costs you $2.00 seating is situated so you're about 6 feet apart as well. and, a popular mexican cable music channel is broadcasted on a little 32\" tv hanging on the wall. the store wasn't messy or smelly, but the look of it was a bit rough and weathered. half the lights didn't illuminate, can't discern if the surfaces where sanitized and the overall look was again, just rough. please don't look down too much on that but it is note worthy. personally, my family and i love dives per se; you can normally find some of the most humble restaurants and even better food.  gripe time. not a fan of restaurants shutting down restrooms for 'covid'. there just isn't enough speaking power to present a convincing stance to me that this needs to be done. it restricts people under emergencies and with medical issues alongside with making the whole experience just better so you can wash your hands afterwards (or before for sanitation!) i'm not a fan of businesses that do this and they do here... overall, delicious food and grateful they're open and if you're in a hurry, the drive-through rocks too!!   \n",

       "8   had to stop into an alternate business across the road on a saturday morning 1 aug 2020  and had to hit a breakfast joint up  los betos was the spot  first thing that i want to recognize is the incredible timeline this place is open monsat 04301000 pm then sunday from 07000600 pm really going the distance here to make the availability to be open so for that I am quite impressed second the food is hot fresh delicious and fast really gotta shout out that this food is delish had a supreme burrito and it was fingerlicking darn delish drinks are not self serve through covid19 at the moment but a large drink only costs you 20 dollars seating is situated so you are about 6 feet apart as well and a popular mexican cable music channel is broadcasted on a little 32 tv hanging on the wall the store was not messy or smelly but the look of it was a bit rough and weathered half the lights did not illuminate cannot discern if the surfaces where sanitized and the overall look was again just rough please do not look down too much on that but it is note worthy personally my family and i love dives per se you can normally find some of the most humble restaurants and even better food  gripe time not a fan of restaurants shutting down restrooms for covid there just is not enough speaking power to present a convincing stance to me that this needs to be done it restricts people under emergencies and with medical issues alongside with making the whole experience just better so you can wash your hands afterwards or before for sanitation I am not a fan of businesses that do this and they do here overall delicious food and grateful they are open and if you are in a hurry the drivethrough rocks too  \n",

       "8   had to stop into an alternate business across the road on a saturday morning (1 aug 2020)  and had to hit a breakfast joint up - los betos was the spot!  first thing that i want to recognize is the incredible timeline this place is open: mon-sat 0430-1000 pm!? then sunday from 0700-0600 pm. really going the distance here to make the availability to be open so for that, i'm quite impressed! second, the food is hot, fresh, delicious and fast! really gotta shout out that this food is delish. had a 'supreme' burrito and it was finger-licking darn delish!! drinks are not self serve through covid-19 at the moment but a large drink only costs you $2.00 seating is situated so you're about 6 feet apart as well. and, a popular mexican cable music channel is broadcasted on a little 32\" tv hanging on the wall. the store wasn't messy or smelly, but the look of it was a bit rough and weathered. half the lights didn't illuminate, can't discern if the surfaces where sanitized and the overall look was again, just rough. please don't look down too much on that but it is note worthy. personally, my family and i love dives per se; you can normally find some of the most humble restaurants and even better food.  gripe time. not a fan of restaurants shutting down restrooms for 'covid'. there just isn't enough speaking power to present a convincing stance to me that this needs to be done. it restricts people under emergencies and with medical issues alongside with making the whole experience just better so you can wash your hands afterwards (or before for sanitation!) i'm not a fan of businesses that do this and they do here... overall, delicious food and grateful they're open and if you're in a hurry, the drive-through rocks too!!   \n",

       "8   had to stop into an alternate business across the road on a saturday morning 1 aug 2020  and had to hit a breakfast joint up  los betos was the spot  first thing that i want to recognize is the incredible timeline this place is open monsat 04301000 pm then sunday from 07000600 pm really going the distance here to make the availability to be open so for that I am quite impressed second the food is hot fresh delicious and fast really gotta shout out that this food is delish had a supreme burrito and it was fingerlicking darn delish drinks are not self serve through covid19 at the moment but a large drink only costs you 20 dollars seating is situated so you are about 6 feet apart as well and a popular mexican cable music channel is broadcasted on a little 32 tv hanging on the wall the store was not messy or smelly but the look of it was a bit rough and weathered half the lights did not illuminate cannot discern if the surfaces where sanitized and the overall look was again just rough please do not look down too much on that but it is note worthy personally my family and i love dives per se you can normally find some of the most humble restaurants and even better food  gripe time not a fan of restaurants shutting down restrooms for covid there just is not enough speaking power to present a convincing stance to me that this needs to be done it restricts people under emergencies and with medical issues alongside with making the whole experience just better so you can wash your hands afterwards or before for sanitation I am not a fan of businesses that do this and they do here overall delicious food and grateful they are open and if you are in a hurry the drivethrough rocks too  \n",

       "1  had to stop into an alternate business across the road on a saturday morning (1 aug 2020)  and had to hit a breakfast joint up - los betos was the spot!  first thing that i want to recognize is the incredible timeline this place is open: mon-sat 0430-1000 pm!? then sunday from 0700-0600 pm. really going the distance here to make the availability to be open so for that, i'm quite impressed! second, the food is hot, fresh, delicious and fast! really gotta shout out that this food is delish. had a 'supreme' burrito and it was finger-licking darn delish!! drinks are not self serve through covid-19 at the moment but a large drink only costs you $2.00 seating is situated so you're about 6 feet apart as well. and, a popular mexican cable music channel is broadcasted on a little 32\" tv hanging on the wall. the store wasn't messy or smelly, but the look of it was a bit rough and weathered. half the lights didn't illuminate, can't discern if the surfaces where sanitized and the overall look was again, just rough. please don't look down too much on that but it is note worthy. personally, my family and i love dives per se; you can normally find some of the most humble restaurants and even better food.  gripe time. not a fan of restaurants shutting down restrooms for 'covid'. there just isn't enough speaking power to present a convincing stance to me that this needs to be done. it restricts people under emergencies and with medical issues alongside with making the whole experience just better so you can wash your hands afterwards (or before for sanitation!) i'm not a fan of businesses that do this and they do here... overall, delicious food and grateful they're open and if you're in a hurry, the drive-through rocks too!!   \n",

       "1  had to stop into an alternate business across the road on a saturday morning (1 aug 2020)  and had to hit a breakfast joint up - los betos was the spot!  first thing that i want to recognize is the incredible timeline this place is open: mon-sat 0430-1000 pm!? then sunday from 0700-0600 pm. really going the distance here to make the availability to be open so for that, i'm quite impressed! second, the food is hot, fresh, delicious and fast! really gotta shout out that this food is delish. had a 'supreme' burrito and it was finger-licking darn delish!! drinks are not self serve through covid-19 at the moment but a large drink only costs you $2.00 seating is situated so you're about 6 feet apart as well. and, a popular mexican cable music channel is broadcasted on a little 32\" tv hanging on the wall. the store wasn't messy or smelly, but the look of it was a bit rough and weathered. half the lights didn't illuminate, can't discern if the surfaces where sanitized and the overall look was again, just rough. please don't look down too much on that but it is note worthy. personally, my family and i love dives per se; you can normally find some of the most humble restaurants and even better food.  gripe time. not a fan of restaurants shutting down restrooms for 'covid'. there just isn't enough speaking power to present a convincing stance to me that this needs to be done. it restricts people under emergencies and with medical issues alongside with making the whole experience just better so you can wash your hands afterwards (or before for sanitation!) i'm not a fan of businesses that do this and they do here... overall, delicious food and grateful they're open and if you're in a hurry, the drive-through rocks too!!   \n",

       "1  had to stop into an alternate business across the road on a saturday morning (1 aug 2020)  and had to hit a breakfast joint up - los betos was the spot!  first thing that i want to recognize is the incredible timeline this place is open: mon-sat 0430-1000 pm!? then sunday from 0700-0600 pm. really going the distance here to make the availability to be open so for that, i'm quite impressed! second, the food is hot, fresh, delicious and fast! really gotta shout out that this food is delish. had a 'supreme' burrito and it was finger-licking darn delish!! drinks are not self serve through covid-19 at the moment but a large drink only costs you $2.00 seating is situated so you're about 6 feet apart as well. and, a popular mexican cable music channel is broadcasted on a little 32\" tv hanging on the wall. the store wasn't messy or smelly, but the look of it was a bit rough and weathered. half the lights didn't illuminate, can't discern if the surfaces where sanitized and the overall look was again, just rough. please don't look down too much on that but it is note worthy. personally, my family and i love dives per se; you can normally find some of the most humble restaurants and even better food.  gripe time. not a fan of restaurants shutting down restrooms for 'covid'. there just isn't enough speaking power to present a convincing stance to me that this needs to be done. it restricts people under emergencies and with medical issues alongside with making the whole experience just better so you can wash your hands afterwards (or before for sanitation!) i'm not a fan of businesses that do this and they do here... overall, delicious food and grateful they're open and if you're in a hurry, the drive-through rocks too!!   \n",
