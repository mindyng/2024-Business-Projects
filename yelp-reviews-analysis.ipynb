I think we might have tried it once a year or two ago, but it wasn't memorable.  I decided to try the HK-style milk tea not too long ago and was hooked.  I think I went here almost every day one week to get the milk tea, only to realize that I should REALLY watch my sugar intake...it's sooo good!  \\n\\nI personally don't think it's better than Zhong Gang's HK-style milk tea because they have their off days when a certain lady makes them (not enough ice, too much ice, etc.).\\n\\nOn a side note:  I wanted to try the crispy roast pork bun, but accidentally said the wrong name in Chinese and got the roast pork bun.  It was decent enough, although I will get to trying the crispy roast pork bun soon!  \\n\\nI will be back~</td>\n",

I think we might have tried it once a year or two ago, but it wasn't memorable.  I decided to try the HK-style milk tea not too long ago and was hooked.  I think I went here almost every day one week to get the milk tea, only to realize that I should REALLY watch my sugar intake...it's sooo good!  \\n\\nI personally don't think it's better than Zhong Gang's HK-style milk tea because they have their off days when a certain lady makes them (not enough ice, too much ice, etc.).\\n\\nOn a side note:  I wanted to try the crispy roast pork bun, but accidentally said the wrong name in Chinese and got the roast pork bun.  It was decent enough, although I will get to trying the crispy roast pork bun soon!  \\n\\nI will be back~   \n",

The prices are affordable, the portions are generous, the staff is friendly, and the food is AMAZING. \\n\\nThe last time I went to the Plum Pit, I ordered a jerk chicken sandwich to split with a friend. Learn from our mistake--order your own sandwich, and if you can't finish it, save half for later. We ended up going back for another sandwich (the one with chicken tenders, mac &amp; cheese, and bacon--I can't remember the name) anyway. We also got two orders of bread pudding to bring home, which, though pretty good cold, is ever better when you heat it up in the oven for 10-15 minutes.</td>\n",

They worked very well together and had a great sense of humor. The next time I'm in the area, I will definitely look them up.

The female cashier was very friendly (flirtatious!) and the pastries shown in nicely adorned display cases. I stopped by early one evening had a sesame ball, which was filled with bean paste. The glutinous rice of the ball was nicely flavored, similar to Bai Tang Gao. Definitely as place worth stopping at if you are in the area.  \n",

They have a decent variety of buns and pastries.  Red bean-filled buns, mung bean-filled buns, coconut stuff, egg tarts etc.  If you buy a dozen, they will give you two more for free.  The prices are standard for a Chinese bakery, with most things at approximately $1.  The service has always been good.  They do serve coffee and tea.  There are a couple of tables inside, with usually the expected group of older Chinese guys chillin' in the corner table debating about something.  Great place to stock up on the buns, which I usually do before leaving town.  \n",

Stupidly delicious. \\n\\nShould be a 4.5 because they were a little slow compared to other trucks, but once the food showed up, totally ON POINT.\\n\\nWe had the bacon Mac and cheese with the French fry bowl, topped with jerk chicken. I could not get enough of the jerk chicken. And the bacon Mac and cheese was super creamy ( again 4.5 we saw a big can of nacho cheese instead of good cheese \" . \\n\\nWould definitely eat here again if they were at the Stables.  \n",

This food was really good! We all got one of almost everything and tasted it. We were so surprised.  The portion size was on point! Chef Floyd and T (Angie was her name on the contract) did a great job executing the orders in the heat. They made a great team. They worked very well together and had a great sense of humor. The next time I'm in the area, I will definitely look them up. If you are having an event and are in or around the Media, Pennsylvania area you should definitely look them up and have their food truck at your next event!  \n",

When the restaurant called to confirm, I requested a table by the railings and they said no problem. Sadly, they didn't have a table reserved for us but had tables reserved for two big parties that were an hour ahead of us so they didn't want to sit us by the railings because of the two big parties. The manager of the hostesses came out to tell us more excuses and only wanted to shake my husbands hand (big mistake being she was a female as well) after apologizing for the confusion. This restaurant really needs to rethink their process. The stupid hostess stand is in the middle of the restaurant and one side of the patio has a consistent line of people. Not a great ambiance for a restaurant at la encantada. Or I would have to say, the lines are due to poor management, probably because the hostess manager doesn't know what she's doing. The food is ok....step up from chipotle I would say. After being treated badly and the restaurant not committed to our reservation time, I don't think we will be back. Tucson has too many good restaurants to settle on this expensive chipotle with rude managers.</td>\n",

Unfortunately, you cannot reserve a lane ahead of time, you have to go there and put your name on the waiting list and wait until a lane is available.  I called around 4pm and asked about the wait for a 7pm start time, and I was told \"get here as soon as you can\" and was there around 5pm (from talking to the staff the normal wait time for a lane on Saturday is 1.5-2 hours).  They really should consider taking reservations with a credit card so you don't have to sit around for hours waiting for a lane to open up.  Another thing, they only allow 7 people to bowl per lane, so if you have more than 7 people in your party, and you go on a Saturday night, you're SOL and some of you are not going to be bowling.\\n\\nThe table for our lane wasn't bused when we got there - there were empty glasses, food, napkins, puddles of liquid, etc. lying around.  Took a bit of time for someone to come over to clean up.  Waitress service is a slow, faster just to go the bar (where there is an equally overworked bartender) and order drinks from there.  The waitress seemed a bit po'ed that some of us got drinks from the bar and not from her.  One of our party ordered a burger from the bar and waited about 30 minutes for it to be served (I guess they had to send the cow to grad school first?)\\n\\nUnlike other bowling alleys, they charge you per hour, rather than for the lane, so if you have a lot of people in your party, NB is making bank.  Also, since it was a Saturday, we were limited to playing only 2 games, which was a disappointment.  Best time to go seems to be during the week and avoid it on a Friday/weekend (it's also much cheaper during the week).\\n\\nIf you go there before 9, be aware that there are going to be unsupervised kids running around.  Thankfully, no one under 21 is allowed after 9.\\n\\nThe music they played was very good, but a bit too loud, as it was very difficult to carry on a conversation with someone standing next to you.\\n\\nWe couldn't go to the upstairs where the air hockey, pool table and other games are, as there were back-to-back private parties and the entire upstairs was off limits.\\n\\nThe bathrooms were not clean and seemed like they belonged in a municipal sports stadium.  I can't believe a facility as nice and clean as NB would have bathrooms like that.</td>\n",

We waited in line, paid for our pizzas and went out to enjoy the outdoor seating with our friends. We waited. And waited. And waited. About 40 minutes after we'd placed our order (and after food had come out for almost everyone else we were sitting with, even those who had ordered way after us), I went back inside and waited in line again to check with the counter about whether our order had been misplaced or something. The guy at the counter assured me that no one forgot about us and promised me he'd dash back to the kitchen to check, and would let us know if anything was wrong. \\n\\nAnother half an hour goes by, all of our friends have gotten, and finished their dinners. Once more I head inside, this time to get a refund. The guy at the counter took my receipt back to the kitchen to check on my order (while admitting that he never made it back to the kitchen last time). When he got back, he explained that we \"must have missed it\" when the folks from the kitchen brought our pizzas outside, and that they've been ready all along, and that the kitchen assures him that they brought out our order at least 3 times. Since that was the news from the kitchen, they wouldn't offer us a refund, but would be willing to bring out our pizzas in to go boxes. We were starving, so we settled for that. We weren't offered an apology, or any attempt to make things right, besides the pizzas we'd paid for over an hour ago, slightly warmed up and an acknowledgment that sometimes these things happen when they get busy. I'm not one to make a scene over something like this, and I was nothing but polite both times we went to check on our food.  I understand that things get busy, and sometimes things can go wrong, but they made it seem like it was our fault (there's no way we missed our food coming out 3 times--the outdoor area is really small and we were paying pretty close attention to all of the orders).  \\n\\nIt's too bad. The pizza was...fine but obviously would have been better fresh from the oven--that's the whole point of places like this. Given that this place is pretty pricey and that the service is so truly terrible, we for sure won't be back.</td>\n",

We had to wait an additional fifteen minutes, so why did I make reservations? When the restaurant called to confirm, I requested a table by the railings and they said no problem. Sadly, they didn't have a table reserved for us but had tables reserved for two big parties that were an hour ahead of us so they didn't want to sit us by the railings because of the two big parties. The manager of the hostesses came out to tell us more excuses and only wanted to shake my husbands hand (big mistake being she was a female as well) after apologizing for the confusion. This restaurant really needs to rethink their process. The stupid hostess stand is in the middle of the restaurant and one side of the patio has a consistent line of people. Not a great ambiance for a restaurant at la encantada. Or I would have to say, the lines are due to poor management, probably because the hostess manager doesn't know what she's doing. The food is ok....step up from chipotle I would say. After being treated badly and the restaurant not committed to our reservation time, I don't think we will be back. Tucson has too many good restaurants to settle on this expensive chipotle with rude managers.   \n",

The menu is really great and the atmosphere is chill for me.  I've been here several times, and never disappointed!  Get your ass in here and partake!   \n",
       "1033901  Went there last Saturday night for a bday party for my gf.  Unfortunately, you cannot reserve a lane ahead of time, you have to go there and put your name on the waiting list and wait until a lane is available.  I called around 4pm and asked about the wait for a 7pm start time, and I was told \"get here as soon as you can\" and was there around 5pm (from talking to the staff the normal wait time for a lane on Saturday is 1.5-2 hours).  They really should consider taking reservations with a credit card so you don't have to sit around for hours waiting for a lane to open up.  Another thing, they only allow 7 people to bowl per lane, so if you have more than 7 people in your party, and you go on a Saturday night, you're SOL and some of you are not going to be bowling.\\n\\nThe table for our lane wasn't bused when we got there - there were empty glasses, food, napkins, puddles of liquid, etc. lying around.  Took a bit of time for someone to come over to clean up.  Waitress service is a slow, faster just to go the bar (where there is an equally overworked bartender) and order drinks from there.  The waitress seemed a bit po'ed that some of us got drinks from the bar and not from her.  One of our party ordered a burger from the bar and waited about 30 minutes for it to be served (I guess they had to send the cow to grad school first?)\\n\\nUnlike other bowling alleys, they charge you per hour, rather than for the lane, so if you have a lot of people in your party, NB is making bank.  Also, since it was a Saturday, we were limited to playing only 2 games, which was a disappointment.  Best time to go seems to be during the week and avoid it on a Friday/weekend (it's also much cheaper during the week).\\n\\nIf you go there before 9, be aware that there are going to be unsupervised kids running around.  Thankfully, no one under 21 is allowed after 9.\\n\\nThe music they played was very good, but a bit too loud, as it was very difficult to carry on a conversation with someone standing next to you.\\n\\nWe couldn't go to the upstairs where the air hockey, pool table and other games are, as there were back-to-back private parties and the entire upstairs was off limits.\\n\\nThe bathrooms were not clean and seemed like they belonged in a municipal sports stadium.  I can't believe a facility as nice and clean as NB would have bathrooms like that.   \n",

After a sad day we all needed a chance to rest and visit with one another and enjoy some good food. I was so impressed with The staffthat I knew it was going to be the perfect spot. We hosted 51 people total and the food was absolutely divine. (The chicken Parmesan was my favorite.) The private room was beautiful and the service was excellent. I won't share what we paid on here because I feel like we got an excellent deal. We also got to bring in our own beer/wine which helped cut down on costs. Now I have a dining room table full of food they sent me home with. Thank you. You gave us a wonderful lunch, and a great place to remember my dad. I won't forget it.   \n",

We met several other friends for a pizza celebration, and I was excited because I had heard such good things about the pizza here. We waited in line, paid for our pizzas and went out to enjoy the outdoor seating with our friends. We waited. And waited. And waited. About 40 minutes after we'd placed our order (and after food had come out for almost everyone else we were sitting with, even those who had ordered way after us), I went back inside and waited in line again to check with the counter about whether our order had been misplaced or something. The guy at the counter assured me that no one forgot about us and promised me he'd dash back to the kitchen to check, and would let us know if anything was wrong. \\n\\nAnother half an hour goes by, all of our friends have gotten, and finished their dinners. Once more I head inside, this time to get a refund. The guy at the counter took my receipt back to the kitchen to check on my order (while admitting that he never made it back to the kitchen last time). When he got back, he explained that we \"must have missed it\" when the folks from the kitchen brought our pizzas outside, and that they've been ready all along, and that the kitchen assures him that they brought out our order at least 3 times. Since that was the news from the kitchen, they wouldn't offer us a refund, but would be willing to bring out our pizzas in to go boxes. We were starving, so we settled for that. We weren't offered an apology, or any attempt to make things right, besides the pizzas we'd paid for over an hour ago, slightly warmed up and an acknowledgment that sometimes these things happen when they get busy. I'm not one to make a scene over something like this, and I was nothing but polite both times we went to check on our food.  I understand that things get busy, and sometimes things can go wrong, but they made it seem like it was our fault (there's no way we missed our food coming out 3 times--the outdoor area is really small and we were paying pretty close attention to all of the orders).  \\n\\nIt's too bad. The pizza was...fine but obviously would have been better fresh from the oven--that's the whole point of places like this. Given that this place is pretty pricey and that the service is so truly terrible, we for sure won't be back.   \n",

The person I was with had the tenderloin sandwich, it was good but not as large as what we usually get in restaurants in this area.\\n\\nWe really liked the ambience, but thought the overall volume in the restaurant was a little high making it very difficult to have a conversation in the restaurant.   \n",

I came with two friends from out of town and our server was fantastic, helping us with Italian pronunciations and reciprocating good-natured teasing. The food was also delicious all around. My spaghetti carbonara was wonderful and came with an incredible bacon-flavored scoop of gelato on top. My friend's seafood spaghetti was good too, but we were really impressed with their gnocchi, which was incredibly soft and creamy (very similar to soft Korean rice cakes). We topped off our meal with wine, tiramisu, two scoops of gelato and a pint of gelato for the road. It was a wonderful dinner experience and I would highly recommend this place.   \n",

We had to wait an additional fifteen minutes, so why did I make reservations? When the restaurant called to confirm, I requested a table by the railings and they said no problem. Sadly, they didn't have a table reserved for us but had tables reserved for two big parties that were an hour ahead of us so they didn't want to sit us by the railings because of the two big parties. The manager of the hostesses came out to tell us more excuses and only wanted to shake my husbands hand (big mistake being she was a female as well) after apologizing for the confusion. This restaurant really needs to rethink their process. The stupid hostess stand is in the middle of the restaurant and one side of the patio has a consistent line of people. Not a great ambiance for a restaurant at la encantada. Or I would have to say, the lines are due to poor management, probably because the hostess manager doesn't know what she's doing. The food is ok....step up from chipotle I would say. After being treated badly and the restaurant not committed to our reservation time, I don't think we will be back. Tucson has too many good restaurants to settle on this expensive chipotle with rude managers.  \n",

       "1033901  Went there last Saturday night for a bday party for my gf.  Unfortunately, you cannot reserve a lane ahead of time, you have to go there and put your name on the waiting list and wait until a lane is available.  I called around 4pm and asked about the wait for a 7pm start time, and I was told \"get here as soon as you can\" and was there around 5pm (from talking to the staff the normal wait time for a lane on Saturday is 1.5-2 hours).  They really should consider taking reservations with a credit card so you don't have to sit around for hours waiting for a lane to open up.  Another thing, they only allow 7 people to bowl per lane, so if you have more than 7 people in your party, and you go on a Saturday night, you're SOL and some of you are not going to be bowling. The table for our lane wasn't bused when we got there - there were empty glasses, food, napkins, puddles of liquid, etc. lying around.  Took a bit of time for someone to come over to clean up.  Waitress service is a slow, faster just to go the bar (where there is an equally overworked bartender) and order drinks from there.  The waitress seemed a bit po'ed that some of us got drinks from the bar and not from her.  One of our party ordered a burger from the bar and waited about 30 minutes for it to be served (I guess they had to send the cow to grad school first?) Unlike other bowling alleys, they charge you per hour, rather than for the lane, so if you have a lot of people in your party, NB is making bank.  Also, since it was a Saturday, we were limited to playing only 2 games, which was a disappointment.  Best time to go seems to be during the week and avoid it on a Friday/weekend (it's also much cheaper during the week). If you go there before 9, be aware that there are going to be unsupervised kids running around.  Thankfully, no one under 21 is allowed after 9. The music they played was very good, but a bit too loud, as it was very difficult to carry on a conversation with someone standing next to you. We couldn't go to the upstairs where the air hockey, pool table and other games are, as there were back-to-back private parties and the entire upstairs was off limits. The bathrooms were not clean and seemed like they belonged in a municipal sports stadium.  I can't believe a facility as nice and clean as NB would have bathrooms like that.  \n",

After a sad day we all needed a chance to rest and visit with one another and enjoy some good food. I was so impressed with The staffthat I knew it was going to be the perfect spot. We hosted 51 people total and the food was absolutely divine. (The chicken Parmesan was my favorite.) The private room was beautiful and the service was excellent. I won't share what we paid on here because I feel like we got an excellent deal. We also got to bring in our own beer/wine which helped cut down on costs. Now I have a dining room table full of food they sent me home with. Thank you. You gave us a wonderful lunch, and a great place to remember my dad. I won't forget it.  \n",

       "1180755                                              A bummer. We met several other friends for a pizza celebration, and I was excited because I had heard such good things about the pizza here. We waited in line, paid for our pizzas and went out to enjoy the outdoor seating with our friends. We waited. And waited. And waited. About 40 minutes after we'd placed our order (and after food had come out for almost everyone else we were sitting with, even those who had ordered way after us), I went back inside and waited in line again to check with the counter about whether our order had been misplaced or something. The guy at the counter assured me that no one forgot about us and promised me he'd dash back to the kitchen to check, and would let us know if anything was wrong.  Another half an hour goes by, all of our friends have gotten, and finished their dinners. Once more I head inside, this time to get a refund. The guy at the counter took my receipt back to the kitchen to check on my order (while admitting that he never made it back to the kitchen last time). When he got back, he explained that we \"must have missed it\" when the folks from the kitchen brought our pizzas outside, and that they've been ready all along, and that the kitchen assures him that they brought out our order at least 3 times. Since that was the news from the kitchen, they wouldn't offer us a refund, but would be willing to bring out our pizzas in to go boxes. We were starving, so we settled for that. We weren't offered an apology, or any attempt to make things right, besides the pizzas we'd paid for over an hour ago, slightly warmed up and an acknowledgment that sometimes these things happen when they get busy. I'm not one to make a scene over something like this, and I was nothing but polite both times we went to check on our food.  I understand that things get busy, and sometimes things can go wrong, but they made it seem like it was our fault (there's no way we missed our food coming out 3 times--the outdoor area is really small and we were paying pretty close attention to all of the orders).   It's too bad. The pizza was...fine but obviously would have been better fresh from the oven--that's the whole point of places like this. Given that this place is pretty pricey and that the service is so truly terrible, we for sure won't be back.  \n",

The person I was with had the tenderloin sandwich, it was good but not as large as what we usually get in restaurants in this area. We really liked the ambience, but thought the overall volume in the restaurant was a little high making it very difficult to have a conversation in the restaurant.  \n",

I came with two friends from out of town and our server was fantastic, helping us with Italian pronunciations and reciprocating good-natured teasing. The food was also delicious all around. My spaghetti carbonara was wonderful and came with an incredible bacon-flavored scoop of gelato on top. My friend's seafood spaghetti was good too, but we were really impressed with their gnocchi, which was incredibly soft and creamy (very similar to soft Korean rice cakes). We topped off our meal with wine, tiramisu, two scoops of gelato and a pint of gelato for the road. It was a wonderful dinner experience and I would highly recommend this place.  \n",

       "      <td>Went there last Saturday night for a bday party for my gf.  Unfortunately, you cannot reserve a lane ahead of time, you have to go there and put your name on the waiting list and wait until a lane is available.  I called around 4pm and asked about the wait for a 7pm start time, and I was told \"get here as soon as you can\" and was there around 5pm (from talking to the staff the normal wait time for a lane on Saturday is 1.5-2 hours).  They really should consider taking reservations with a credit card so you don't have to sit around for hours waiting for a lane to open up.  Another thing, they only allow 7 people to bowl per lane, so if you have more than 7 people in your party, and you go on a Saturday night, you're SOL and some of you are not going to be bowling.\\n\\nThe table for our lane wasn't bused when we got there - there were empty glasses, food, napkins, puddles of liquid, etc. lying around.  Took a bit of time for someone to come over to clean up.  Waitress service is a slow, faster just to go the bar (where there is an equally overworked bartender) and order drinks from there.  The waitress seemed a bit po'ed that some of us got drinks from the bar and not from her.  One of our party ordered a burger from the bar and waited about 30 minutes for it to be served (I guess they had to send the cow to grad school first?)\\n\\nUnlike other bowling alleys, they charge you per hour, rather than for the lane, so if you have a lot of people in your party, NB is making bank.  Also, since it was a Saturday, we were limited to playing only 2 games, which was a disappointment.  Best time to go seems to be during the week and avoid it on a Friday/weekend (it's also much cheaper during the week).\\n\\nIf you go there before 9, be aware that there are going to be unsupervised kids running around.  Thankfully, no one under 21 is allowed after 9.\\n\\nThe music they played was very good, but a bit too loud, as it was very difficult to carry on a conversation with someone standing next to you.\\n\\nWe couldn't go to the upstairs where the air hockey, pool table and other games are, as there were back-to-back private parties and the entire upstairs was off limits.\\n\\nThe bathrooms were not clean and seemed like they belonged in a municipal sports stadium.  I can't believe a facility as nice and clean as NB would have bathrooms like that.</td>\n",

After a sad day we all needed a chance to rest and visit with one another and enjoy some good food. I was so impressed with The staffthat I knew it was going to be the perfect spot. We hosted 51 people total and the food was absolutely divine. (The chicken Parmesan was my favorite.) The private room was beautiful and the service was excellent. I won't share what we paid on here because I feel like we got an excellent deal. We also got to bring in our own beer/wine which helped cut down on costs.

We had to wait an additional fifteen minutes, so why did I make reservations? When the restaurant called to confirm, I requested a table by the railings and they said no problem. Sadly, they didn't have a table reserved for us but had tables reserved for two big parties that were an hour ahead of us so they didn't want to sit us by the railings because of the two big parties. The manager of the hostesses came out to tell us more excuses and only wanted to shake my husbands hand (big mistake being she was a female as well) after apologizing for the confusion. This restaurant really needs to rethink their process. The stupid hostess stand is in the middle of the restaurant and one side of the patio has a consistent line of people. Not a great ambiance for a restaurant at la encantada. Or I would have to say, the lines are due to poor management, probably because the hostess manager doesn't know what she's doing. The food is ok....step up from chipotle I would say. After being treated badly and the restaurant not committed to our reservation time, I don't think we will be back. Tucson has too many good restaurants to settle on this expensive chipotle with rude managers.   \n",

       "1033901  Went there last Saturday night for a bday party for my gf.  Unfortunately, you cannot reserve a lane ahead of time, you have to go there and put your name on the waiting list and wait until a lane is available.  I called around 4pm and asked about the wait for a 7pm start time, and I was told \"get here as soon as you can\" and was there around 5pm (from talking to the staff the normal wait time for a lane on Saturday is 1.5-2 hours).  They really should consider taking reservations with a credit card so you don't have to sit around for hours waiting for a lane to open up.  Another thing, they only allow 7 people to bowl per lane, so if you have more than 7 people in your party, and you go on a Saturday night, you're SOL and some of you are not going to be bowling.\\n\\nThe table for our lane wasn't bused when we got there - there were empty glasses, food, napkins, puddles of liquid, etc. lying around.  Took a bit of time for someone to come over to clean up.  Waitress service is a slow, faster just to go the bar (where there is an equally overworked bartender) and order drinks from there.  The waitress seemed a bit po'ed that some of us got drinks from the bar and not from her.  One of our party ordered a burger from the bar and waited about 30 minutes for it to be served (I guess they had to send the cow to grad school first?)\\n\\nUnlike other bowling alleys, they charge you per hour, rather than for the lane, so if you have a lot of people in your party, NB is making bank.  Also, since it was a Saturday, we were limited to playing only 2 games, which was a disappointment.  Best time to go seems to be during the week and avoid it on a Friday/weekend (it's also much cheaper during the week).\\n\\nIf you go there before 9, be aware that there are going to be unsupervised kids running around.  Thankfully, no one under 21 is allowed after 9.\\n\\nThe music they played was very good, but a bit too loud, as it was very difficult to carry on a conversation with someone standing next to you.\\n\\nWe couldn't go to the upstairs where the air hockey, pool table and other games are, as there were back-to-back private parties and the entire upstairs was off limits.\\n\\nThe bathrooms were not clean and seemed like they belonged in a municipal sports stadium.  I can't believe a facility as nice and clean as NB would have bathrooms like that.   \n",

After a sad day we all needed a chance to rest and visit with one another and enjoy some good food. I was so impressed with The staffthat I knew it was going to be the perfect spot. We hosted 51 people total and the food was absolutely divine. (The chicken Parmesan was my favorite.) The private room was beautiful and the service was excellent. I won't share what we paid on here because I feel like we got an excellent deal. We also got to bring in our own beer/wine which helped cut down on costs. Now I have a dining room table full of food they sent me home with. Thank you. You gave us a wonderful lunch, and a great place to remember my dad. I won't forget it.   \n",

       "1033901  went there last saturday night for a bday party for my gf.  unfortunately, you cannot reserve a lane ahead of time, you have to go there and put your name on the waiting list and wait until a lane is available.  i called around 4pm and asked about the wait for a 7pm start time, and i was told \"get here as soon as you can\" and was there around 5pm (from talking to the staff the normal wait time for a lane on saturday is 1.5-2 hours).  they really should consider taking reservations with a credit card so you don't have to sit around for hours waiting for a lane to open up.  another thing, they only allow 7 people to bowl per lane, so if you have more than 7 people in your party, and you go on a saturday night, you're sol and some of you are not going to be bowling. the table for our lane wasn't bused when we got there - there were empty glasses, food, napkins, puddles of liquid, etc. lying around.  took a bit of time for someone to come over to clean up.  waitress service is a slow, faster just to go the bar (where there is an equally overworked bartender) and order drinks from there.  the waitress seemed a bit po'ed that some of us got drinks from the bar and not from her.  one of our party ordered a burger from the bar and waited about 30 minutes for it to be served (i guess they had to send the cow to grad school first?) unlike other bowling alleys, they charge you per hour, rather than for the lane, so if you have a lot of people in your party, nb is making bank.  also, since it was a saturday, we were limited to playing only 2 games, which was a disappointment.  best time to go seems to be during the week and avoid it on a friday/weekend (it's also much cheaper during the week). if you go there before 9, be aware that there are going to be unsupervised kids running around.  thankfully, no one under 21 is allowed after 9. the music they played was very good, but a bit too loud, as it was very difficult to carry on a conversation with someone standing next to you. we couldn't go to the upstairs where the air hockey, pool table and other games are, as there were back-to-back private parties and the entire upstairs was off limits. the bathrooms were not clean and seemed like they belonged in a municipal sports stadium.  i can't believe a facility as nice and clean as nb would have bathrooms like that.   \n",

After a sad day we all needed a chance to rest and visit with one another and enjoy some good food. I was so impressed with The staffthat I knew it was going to be the perfect spot. We hosted 51 people total and the food was absolutely divine. (The chicken Parmesan was my favorite.) The private room was beautiful and the service was excellent. I won't share what we paid on here because I feel like we got an excellent deal. We also got to bring in our own beer/wine which helped cut down on costs. Now I have a dining room table full of food they sent me home with. Thank you. You gave us a wonderful lunch, and a great place to remember my dad. I won't forget it.   \n",

       "0  we made reservations and our table wasn't ready when we arrived. we had to wait an additional fifteen minutes, so why did i make reservations? when the restaurant called to confirm, i requested a table by the railings and they said no problem. sadly, they didn't have a table reserved for us but had tables reserved for two big parties that were an hour ahead of us so they didn't want to sit us by the railings because of the two big parties. the manager of the hostesses came out to tell us more excuses and only wanted to shake my husbands hand (big mistake being she was a female as well) after apologizing for the confusion. this restaurant really needs to rethink their process. the stupid hostess stand is in the middle of the restaurant and one side of the patio has a consistent line of people. not a great ambiance for a restaurant at la encantada. or i would have to say, the lines are due to poor management, probably because the hostess manager doesn't know what she's doing. the food is ok....step up from chipotle i would say. after being treated badly and the restaurant not committed to our reservation time, i don't think we will be back. tucson has too many good restaurants to settle on this expensive chipotle with rude managers.   \n",

(the chicken parmesan was my favorite.) the private room was beautiful and the service was excellent. i won't share what we paid on here because i feel like we got an excellent deal. we also got to bring in our own beer/wine which helped cut down on costs. now i have a dining room table full of food they sent me home with. thank you. you gave us a wonderful lunch, and a great place to remember my dad. i won't forget it.   \n",

       "439855  i really wanted to like this place because they had chill outdoor space, and decent space inside as well but they just could not get service together for brunch. missed orders, missing items from other orders and what happened to be the sausage debacle of 2018 as they kept bringing out pieces of ground beef without any flavors, seasoning or casing and claiming that that was how they made sausages.  the best was when they brought out two hamburger patties at one point saying those were their sausage patties... ummm it's okay to say you dont have it on the menu, like we get it. we laughed about it after the fact but definitely one of the worst brunch experiences i've had in philly. with the plethora of brunch spots elsewhere i would skip over this one. maybe they have a better bar scene....who knows   \n",
