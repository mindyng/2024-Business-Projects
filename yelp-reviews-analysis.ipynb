I think we might have tried it once a year or two ago, but it wasn't memorable.  I decided to try the HK-style milk tea not too long ago and was hooked.  I think I went here almost every day one week to get the milk tea, only to realize that I should REALLY watch my sugar intake...it's sooo good!  \\n\\nI personally don't think it's better than Zhong Gang's HK-style milk tea because they have their off days when a certain lady makes them (not enough ice, too much ice, etc.).\\n\\nOn a side note:  I wanted to try the crispy roast pork bun, but accidentally said the wrong name in Chinese and got the roast pork bun.

       "4  HK-STYLE MILK TEA:  FOUR STARS\\n\\nNot quite sure why there are two Saint Honore Pastries business listings on Yelp, but I have been checking in to this one.\\n\\nBoyfriend and I go by it all the time while in Chinatown, but it never crossed our mind to try it.  I think we might have tried it once a year or two ago, but it wasn't memorable.  I decided to try the HK-style milk tea not too long ago and was hooked.  I think I went here almost every day one week to get the milk tea, only to realize that I should REALLY watch my sugar intake...it's sooo good!  \\n\\nI personally don't think it's better than Zhong Gang's HK-style milk tea because they have their off days when a certain lady makes them (not enough ice, too much ice, etc.).\\n\\nOn a side note:  I wanted to try the crispy roast pork bun, but accidentally said the wrong name in Chinese and got the roast pork bun.  It was decent enough, although I will get to trying the crispy roast pork bun soon!  \\n\\nI will be back~   \n",

The glutinous rice of the ball was nicely flavored, similar to Bai Tang Gao. Definitely as place worth stopping at if you are in the area.  \n",

They have a decent variety of buns and pastries.  Red bean-filled buns, mung bean-filled buns, coconut stuff, egg tarts etc.  If you buy a dozen, they will give you two more for free.  The prices are standard for a Chinese bakery, with most things at approximately $1.  The service has always been good.  They do serve coffee and tea.  There are a couple of tables inside, with usually the expected group of older Chinese guys chillin' in the corner table debating about something.  Great place to stock up on the buns, which I usually do before leaving town.  \n",

Stupidly delicious. \\n\\nShould be a 4.5 because they were a little slow compared to other trucks, but once the food showed up, totally ON POINT.\\n\\nWe had the bacon Mac and cheese with the French fry bowl, topped with jerk chicken. I could not get enough of the jerk chicken. And the bacon Mac and cheese was super creamy ( again 4.5 we saw a big can of nacho cheese instead of good cheese \" . \\n\\nWould definitely eat here again if they were at the Stables.  \n",

This food was really good! We all got one of almost everything and tasted it. We were so surprised.  The portion size was on point! Chef Floyd and T (Angie was her name on the contract) did a great job executing the orders in the heat. They made a great team. They worked very well together and had a great sense of humor. The next time I'm in the area, I will definitely look them up. If you are having an event and are in or around the Media, Pennsylvania area you should definitely look them up and have their food truck at your next event!  \n",

I was able to find a street parking spot around the corner and had a short walk to Matt the Miller's, enjoying the nice scenery right outside the restaurant. Overall the prices are a little high and I didn't see too many things on the menu that I would be interested in. I decided to get the Bavarian Pretzel Bites as my meal and also ordered their Friday drink special. I heard so many good things about these pretzels but I was a little disappointed. They didn't taste like pretzels at all. I don't think they had salt on them, so to me they tasted more like rolls. They were good, especially with the dips (the dips weren't listed on the menu so I'm not sure what they were), but just not what I was expecting. The service was phenomenal though. I hope to return some time soon.</td>\n",

We decided to take her vast knowledge of the menu and ordered the pawn in salmon pasta and the pork dish Gucci. Needless to say every single morsel was consumed with a smile on our faces!

       "3297502  Made a reservation online for a busy Friday night. I was able to find a street parking spot around the corner and had a short walk to Matt the Miller's, enjoying the nice scenery right outside the restaurant. Overall the prices are a little high and I didn't see too many things on the menu that I would be interested in. I decided to get the Bavarian Pretzel Bites as my meal and also ordered their Friday drink special. I heard so many good things about these pretzels but I was a little disappointed. They didn't taste like pretzels at all. I don't think they had salt on them, so to me they tasted more like rolls. They were good, especially with the dips (the dips weren't listed on the menu so I'm not sure what they were), but just not what I was expecting. The service was phenomenal though. I hope to return some time soon.   \n",

I've been spending a lot of time there lately, and I was pleased to be informed that Ichiban was here amidst chain restaurants and car dealerships. \\n\\nHere is your quick rundown of Ichiban: cheap drinks, cheap appetizers, good midwest sushi, and a quiet atmosphere. Everything I've tried here has been great! I usually go for nigiri, and it's pretty difficult to mess that up. (Except if you are Bluefin Bistro in Lafayette). Pretty typical midwest sushi fare, if you haven't eaten sushi on a coast, you're not doing it right. \\n\\nIchiban is a wonderful respite from the hub-hub of the people who don't know how to drive on the south side. Kick back with a tasty beverage, and eat yourself silly with healthy sushi.   \n",

The food was okay, but the service was absolutely horrible. It was hard to get water, and the bread came out right when the meal arrived. It was a long process for everything. It would help out if the managers would not allow the employees to text or use their phones. I can't say I would recommend this place to friends in the future when they come here for vacation. I hope that they can improve!   \n",

The jalapeno sweetbread makes me want to hunt down the chef and attack him!  Ok...he totally deserves that James Beard award! The decor is modern with touch of trendy eco-cool.  Green is the new black, right? Seriously fine cuisine that'll knock the jambalaya off your socks!  \n",
       "3297502  Made a reservation online for a busy Friday night. I was able to find a street parking spot around the corner and had a short walk to Matt the Miller's, enjoying the nice scenery right outside the restaurant. Overall the prices are a little high and I didn't see too many things on the menu that I would be interested in. I decided to get the Bavarian Pretzel Bites as my meal and also ordered their Friday drink special. I heard so many good things about these pretzels but I was a little disappointed. They didn't taste like pretzels at all. I don't think they had salt on them, so to me they tasted more like rolls. They were good, especially with the dips (the dips weren't listed on the menu so I'm not sure what they were), but just not what I was expecting. The service was phenomenal though. I hope to return some time soon.  \n",

I've been spending a lot of time there lately, and I was pleased to be informed that Ichiban was here amidst chain restaurants and car dealerships.  Here is your quick rundown of Ichiban: cheap drinks, cheap appetizers, good midwest sushi, and a quiet atmosphere. Everything I've tried here has been great! I usually go for nigiri, and it's pretty difficult to mess that up. (Except if you are Bluefin Bistro in Lafayette). Pretty typical midwest sushi fare, if you haven't eaten sushi on a coast, you're not doing it right.  Ichiban is a wonderful respite from the hub-hub of the people who don't know how to drive on the south side. Kick back with a tasty beverage, and eat yourself silly with healthy sushi.  \n",

The food was okay, but the service was absolutely horrible. It was hard to get water, and the bread came out right when the meal arrived. It was a long process for everything. It would help out if the managers would not allow the employees to text or use their phones. I can't say I would recommend this place to friends in the future when they come here for vacation. I hope that they can improve!  \n",

       "2699090  Absolutely, positively an amazing experience! The atmosphere and food was nothing short of first class! Our waitress Mandy was superb and her expertise in food choices and drinks was second to none!  The decadent appetizers she recommended was mouth watering and left us in awe of what was to come. We decided to take her vast knowledge of the menu and ordered the pawn in salmon pasta and the pork dish Gucci. Needless to say every single morsel was consumed with a smile on our faces! Mandy was the cherry on the top of our dining experience at twigs! Give this woman a raise now! See my photos... I guarantee you will not be disappointed!   \n",

This is a great place to get in touch with your Irish roots, though for me those are distant roots but just a hop and a skip on a ferry from England where I couldn't get a better serving of corn beef and cabbage if I searched out the finest of pups and all the land, Dargan's is Irie my friends. On St. Patrick's Day, when in Santa Barbara, it is a tradition to get you some shots of Jamison's and green beer at the James Joyce O'Malley's and/or Dargan's!!   \n",

Both times I waited, but this time I was in line for over 2 1/2 hours. When I was finally seated, it took the waitress very long for me and my guest to even get water. I ordered the Santa Fe turkey burger. It was so extremely salty, that I was not able to eat it. I joked with my friend about not only the saltiness of the meal, but of the 3 pieces of black beans that were placed on the patty. When I asked to have it replaced, the turkey burger came with no beans, and a few pieces of corn. This was an overpriced turkey burger that was definitely NOT worth the wait.   \n",

       "460473  There is so much to like about this place. The atmosphere is amazing and the service has been consistently great and friendly. And the food looks beautiful. But there are simply two things I cannot get beyond, and unfortunately, I think they are killers for a restaurant.\\n\\nThe food is slightly above average at best, which is perfectly fine.\\n\\nBut the prices reflect food that should be better than it is. So, I would like to get that out of the way right now. \\n\\nI do not think the food is bad. \\n\\nI just don't think it's a great value. \\n\\nWith that out of the way, I have consumed the following at this place over my repeated attempts at \"giving it another chance.\"\\n\\nMama's Meatballs (small plate)\\nCeCi (small plate)\\nMargherita Pizza\\nBlanco Pizza\\nPurple Rain Pizza\\nNomad Pizza\\nPaulie Gee Pizza\\nWedge Salad\\nCaesar Salad\\n\\nAs you can see, I am not making this opinion off of a one-off visit. I consistently gave the place a shot over and over because I like everything else about it so much. But ultimately, the taste never matched my wallet.\\n\\nI can strongly recommend eating anything they have on their menu that contains basil. They have wonderful basil.   \n",

       "4   came here on a late sunday with the guys - there was quite a line outside, maybe 10-15 people ahead of us but it was actually moving pretty quickly which was nice. when we finally got inside we saw that the place wasn't even really that full - maybe 70%. figures they were probably throttling the customers a little bit as to not overload the servers.  anyway - we ended up getting seated upstairs which was cool. our drinks unfortunately took a long time to come out. our server said they ran out of root beer upstairs so.. i guess they had to go find some downstairs.. but it shouldn't take 15 min to walk a flight of stairs right? food came out shortly after the drinks and then the waitress disappeared for a while. she never came back to check on us by the time we finished our meal. we ended up having to flag 2 different people down just to find her. we did end up ordering some desserts and they came out ok.  overall dining experience was ok, the place is pretty happenin' which is cool but the service could have been better. seems to be the trend in this neck of the woods with tip being added automatically to most places. hopefully you will get better service than we did.   \n",

       "24  i'm trying to figure out if i've been under a rock, because i've lived here my entire life (i'm 26 now), and i've never been here... until yesterday! it's official: i'm a fan (and i should be very disappointed in myself for waiting so long to try this place). eating on a budget? yes! this is for you, yeah you over there who wants to eat good and have enough to play after? follow me! cal-neva (where top deck is located in) is not the best location, which is probably why i've driven past the $4.99 steak & eggs sign countless times without giving it a 2nd thought.  but, please, please, do come in! it's not a luxury restaurant, but they do provide luxury customer service :)  drive into the attached parking garage, waddle past the slot machines, and be greeted by an amazing, friendly staff! i'm not even kidding, i might go back just to feel so special again! we ordered:steak & eggs $4.99belgian waffle (huge and delicious) i think it was $5.99future me is interested in ordering: prime rib ($6.99) or steak & lobster ($9.99) i'm never going to denny's or mel's again. it tastes the same, and it's cheaper. win, win! however, the soda is a generic soda, so if you're picky about that, you're probably too picky to be here... but not i! i definitely recommend it and i can't wait to go back!  *caution: it is sketchy, lol. i'm definitely not going to cover up the risk factor, but you're in downtown, so, come in groups and learn some karate... jk.   \n",

       "      <td>i was at peche restaurant last week while visiting new orleans for the first time. i was with a couple of girlfriends. we were there attending a national nursing conference. this restaurant had great reviews and at first bite, i could see why. the food was excellent!  this is why i could at least give 2 stars. my friends and i were seated at a back table near where the food comes out. we observed on numerous occasions, the waiters touching their hair, wiping the face, nose and mouth with bare hands and then directly touching the salads in the plates and handling the trays. after a while of viewing this behavior, we brought it to the managers attention who thanked us for letting him know and said he was going to observe the staff for the behavior himself. we were there for about another hour and the behavior continued. we tipped our waitress nicely, who was awesome!  we saw the managers on the way out and decided to let him know of our disappointment in seeing the behavior continue. he simply said \"i'm sorry you feel that way\". if restaurant staff does things like rubbing their nose and touching their hair and face and then handle your food in front of you, i shutter to think what they would do behind closed doors.  i don't plan on ever eating at that restaurant again, as long as it's under the same management. and i encourage you to do the same.</td>\n",

       "10                                   i was at peche restaurant last week while visiting new orleans for the first time. i was with a couple of girlfriends. we were there attending a national nursing conference. this restaurant had great reviews and at first bite, i could see why. the food was excellent!  this is why i could at least give 2 stars. my friends and i were seated at a back table near where the food comes out. we observed on numerous occasions, the waiters touching their hair, wiping the face, nose and mouth with bare hands and then directly touching the salads in the plates and handling the trays. after a while of viewing this behavior, we brought it to the managers attention who thanked us for letting him know and said he was going to observe the staff for the behavior himself. we were there for about another hour and the behavior continued. we tipped our waitress nicely, who was awesome!  we saw the managers on the way out and decided to let him know of our disappointment in seeing the behavior continue. he simply said \"i'm sorry you feel that way\". if restaurant staff does things like rubbing their nose and touching their hair and face and then handle your food in front of you, i shutter to think what they would do behind closed doors.  i don't plan on ever eating at that restaurant again, as long as it's under the same management. and i encourage you to do the same.   \n",

       "25  sadly the experience was overshadowed by a unenthusiastic waiter who clearly doesn't understand the concept of a \"professional waiter.\"   the food was delicious. and that's the positive  part of this review.we, the 6 of us, met at the mill for a fun and low key dinner. several of us appreciated the free valet parking as it was raining and there was no parking on the street outside the restaurant.they seated the first folks there quickly. my fiancé ordered a captain and coke. the waiter came back and said \"we don't have captain or coke.\" didn't offer any options. when asked well what spiced rum do you have, his response\" well what do you want?\"  seriously?!?!  he told you what he wanted and you don't have it. we asked, do you have diet coke, the answer, \"yeah i think so.\" we ordered dinner after about 15 minutes. everything was available, no problems.after dinner we split a huge delicious piece, yes one piece, of chocolate cake. our italian friend asked \" can i have a strong italian espresso?\" the cheery (sarcasm included here)  waiter says, \"it comes out how it comes out.\"  nice. they don't serve decaf, just so you know. the prices are  medium, certainly not a cheap evening out.  which given the food quality is reasonable. but with the lack of certain routine items and a waiter with an attitude, we will be hard pressed to return to the mill for our frequent friends evening out.   \n",

       "28                                                                                                                                                     i feel that i'm being rather generous giving a 2-star rating since most of my dinner experience wasn't 100% awful. just to quickly go through the good parts of my dinner here: the waiter was nice and checked on us frequently enough, the salmon salad was decent, and the hot spinach dip was exactly what you might expect of a spinach cheese dip.  all rather good things. the highlight however is how bad the cajun jambalaya pasta came out.  if you're unfamiliar with the dish, it is a linguine served with chicken and shrimp in cajun seasoning.  the chicken and shrimp were solid; no complaints at all.   now now, i've had cajun seasoning on food before but under no circumstances have i ever had anything taste as salty as the pasta did.  have you ever gargled salt water to help treat a sore throat? now imagine pasta tasting even saltier than that salt water rinsing around your mouth.  i couldn't believe how that could even happen and i really couldn't convince myself not to waste the food.  i'm the type of person that will eat everything i order pretty much as long as it doesn't touch the floor.  this linguine was the first thing i've ever been incapable of stomaching beyond the first bite. recommendation: do not get the cajun jambalaya pasta   \n",

       "      <td>ok so i have been going down for pizza before the footballs games for years. i recently have been coming to no anchovies more and more and it's really growing on me. the only reason it has to grow on me was that i saw this place being built when i was in school and it really sucked before. harsh words but i went a few time back in 97-98 and this place was average at best.  i spent most of my time next door to my still favorite frog and saying why can't no anchovies be something like them.  fast forward it 15 years and no no anchovies is the place to be and i can see why! now it's right on par with frog and i'm alright with that! first off the outdoor patio is rocking with music, tvs, and they have a full bar with amazing craft beers. very good prices on them too. back in the 90s (wow i sound old!) and there was nothing like that back then. but the pizza was always just average in my memories but now i. really starting to like no anchovies pizza too.  anyways i will come back here and it makes me happy that university drive now has two great places to relax or watch a game and eat great pizza and craft beers.</td>\n",

       "4     there is so much to like about this place. the atmosphere is amazing and the service has been consistently great and friendly. and the food looks beautiful. but there are simply two things i cannot get beyond, and unfortunately, i think they are killers for a restaurant. the food is slightly above average at best, which is perfectly fine. but the prices reflect food that should be better than it is. so, i would like to get that out of the way right now.  i do not think the food is bad.  i just don't think it's a great value.  with that out of the way, i have consumed the following at this place over my repeated attempts at \"giving it another chance.\" mama's meatballs (small plate)ceci (small plate)margherita pizzablanco pizzapurple rain pizzanomad pizzapaulie gee pizzawedge saladcaesar salad as you can see, i am not making this opinion off of a one-off visit. i consistently gave the place a shot over and over because i like everything else about it so much. but ultimately, the taste never matched my wallet. i can strongly recommend eating anything they have on their menu that contains basil. they have wonderful basil.   \n",

       "4995            ok so i have been going down for pizza before the footballs games for years. i recently have been coming to no anchovies more and more and it's really growing on me. the only reason it has to grow on me was that i saw this place being built when i was in school and it really sucked before. harsh words but i went a few time back in 97-98 and this place was average at best.  i spent most of my time next door to my still favorite frog and saying why can't no anchovies be something like them.  fast forward it 15 years and no no anchovies is the place to be and i can see why! now it's right on par with frog and i'm alright with that! first off the outdoor patio is rocking with music, tvs, and they have a full bar with amazing craft beers. very good prices on them too. back in the 90s (wow i sound old!) and there was nothing like that back then. but the pizza was always just average in my memories but now i. really starting to like no anchovies pizza too.  anyways i will come back here and it makes me happy that university drive now has two great places to relax or watch a game and eat great pizza and craft beers.   \n",
