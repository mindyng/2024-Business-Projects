I think we might have tried it once a year or two ago, but it wasn't memorable.  I decided to try the HK-style milk tea not too long ago and was hooked.  I think I went here almost every day one week to get the milk tea, only to realize that I should REALLY watch my sugar intake...it's sooo good!  \\n\\nI personally don't think it's better than Zhong Gang's HK-style milk tea because they have their off days when a certain lady makes them (not enough ice, too much ice, etc.).\\n\\nOn a side note:  I wanted to try the crispy roast pork bun, but accidentally said the wrong name in Chinese and got the roast pork bun.

The female cashier was very friendly (flirtatious!) and the pastries shown in nicely adorned display cases. I stopped by early one evening had a sesame ball, which was filled with bean paste. The glutinous rice of the ball was nicely flavored, similar to Bai Tang Gao. Definitely as place worth stopping at if you are in the area.   \n",

They have a decent variety of buns and pastries.  Red bean-filled buns, mung bean-filled buns, coconut stuff, egg tarts etc.  If you buy a dozen, they will give you two more for free.  The prices are standard for a Chinese bakery, with most things at approximately $1.  The service has always been good.  They do serve coffee and tea.  There are a couple of tables inside, with usually the expected group of older Chinese guys chillin' in the corner table debating about something.  Great place to stock up on the buns, which I usually do before leaving town.   \n",

       "4  HK-STYLE MILK TEA:  FOUR STARS\\n\\nNot quite sure why there are two Saint Honore Pastries business listings on Yelp, but I have been checking in to this one.\\n\\nBoyfriend and I go by it all the time while in Chinatown, but it never crossed our mind to try it.  I think we might have tried it once a year or two ago, but it wasn't memorable.  I decided to try the HK-style milk tea not too long ago and was hooked.  I think I went here almost every day one week to get the milk tea, only to realize that I should REALLY watch my sugar intake...it's sooo good!  \\n\\nI personally don't think it's better than Zhong Gang's HK-style milk tea because they have their off days when a certain lady makes them (not enough ice, too much ice, etc.).\\n\\nOn a side note:  I wanted to try the crispy roast pork bun, but accidentally said the wrong name in Chinese and got the roast pork bun.  It was decent enough, although I will get to trying the crispy roast pork bun soon!  \\n\\nI will be back~   \n",

The glutinous rice of the ball was nicely flavored, similar to Bai Tang Gao. Definitely as place worth stopping at if you are in the area.  \n",

They have a decent variety of buns and pastries.  Red bean-filled buns, mung bean-filled buns, coconut stuff, egg tarts etc.  If you buy a dozen, they will give you two more for free.  The prices are standard for a Chinese bakery, with most things at approximately $1.  The service has always been good.  They do serve coffee and tea.  There are a couple of tables inside, with usually the expected group of older Chinese guys chillin' in the corner table debating about something.  Great place to stock up on the buns, which I usually do before leaving town.  \n",

Stupidly delicious. \\n\\nShould be a 4.5 because they were a little slow compared to other trucks, but once the food showed up, totally ON POINT.\\n\\nWe had the bacon Mac and cheese with the French fry bowl, topped with jerk chicken. I could not get enough of the jerk chicken. And the bacon Mac and cheese was super creamy ( again 4.5 we saw a big can of nacho cheese instead of good cheese \" . \\n\\nWould definitely eat here again if they were at the Stables.  \n",

This food was really good! We all got one of almost everything and tasted it. We were so surprised.  The portion size was on point! Chef Floyd and T (Angie was her name on the contract) did a great job executing the orders in the heat. They made a great team. They worked very well together and had a great sense of humor. The next time I'm in the area, I will definitely look them up. If you are having an event and are in or around the Media, Pennsylvania area you should definitely look them up and have their food truck at your next event!  \n",

The exterior was inviting as was the interior, I felt like I was visiting the home of a Greek relative. The picture of the owner and his son as soon as I walked in almost ensured a fantastic meal, because it's the same owner as Mykonos across the Street, and their food is always fresh and imaginative. Service was good, our waitress worked hard, and we didn't have to wait, our issue was the food. I ordered the Thalassina which is a combination of chargrilled Octopus, squid, scallops, and shrimp. Being a seafood lover, and Greek, I expected the dish to be full of flavor, all I tasted was oil. It was cooked properly, not overdone, not raw, the taste however truly took away from the $22 dish. I sampled my wife's Greek salad which met every expectation desired for a Greek Salad, Crisp red tomatoes, Kalamata Olives that were plump not soft, lettuce that was so crisp, just hearing the crunch made my mouth water. The feta cheese was of a great quality as well. I sampled a bit of Chicken Souvlaki, and this was where my biggest upset was. The chicken was over cooked, and seasoned only with pepper, not marinated in lemon with traditional Greek seasonings, the Tzatziki took up the slack that the chicken left behind. I had only wished it was better. All in all I probably would not visit again, I would rather visit Mykonos, enjoy better food for a more economical price. Please fix this location, add some more creativity to the food, and a little more imagination.</td>\n",

The service is excellent, the servings are generous, the biscuits are perfect. Ed, the general manager,is good about checking on tables and is committed to serving his community. He can be seen giving out coffee to the homeless in the winter and helping them out in other ways as he can. I love supporting a restaurant with great food and a passion for the community.!   \n",
       "1257196  I wanted to love this place because of all the renovation work that had been done since it was Santorini, sadly it does not hold up to the hype. The exterior was inviting as was the interior, I felt like I was visiting the home of a Greek relative. The picture of the owner and his son as soon as I walked in almost ensured a fantastic meal, because it's the same owner as Mykonos across the Street, and their food is always fresh and imaginative. Service was good, our waitress worked hard, and we didn't have to wait, our issue was the food. I ordered the Thalassina which is a combination of chargrilled Octopus, squid, scallops, and shrimp. Being a seafood lover, and Greek, I expected the dish to be full of flavor, all I tasted was oil. It was cooked properly, not overdone, not raw, the taste however truly took away from the $22 dish. I sampled my wife's Greek salad which met every expectation desired for a Greek Salad, Crisp red tomatoes, Kalamata Olives that were plump not soft, lettuce that was so crisp, just hearing the crunch made my mouth water. The feta cheese was of a great quality as well. I sampled a bit of Chicken Souvlaki, and this was where my biggest upset was. The chicken was over cooked, and seasoned only with pepper, not marinated in lemon with traditional Greek seasonings, the Tzatziki took up the slack that the chicken left behind. I had only wished it was better. All in all I probably would not visit again, I would rather visit Mykonos, enjoy better food for a more economical price. Please fix this location, add some more creativity to the food, and a little more imagination.   \n",

I had a 6\" Maddy with mushrooms.  My daughters had an 11\" gluten-free crust with pepperoni, sausage, and hamburger, which they said was excellent. We also had a spinach and asiago salad.  Huge bowl.\\n\\nI had been to the Maryland Heights  location many times, but this location is better- there was pleasant background music instead of loud noise trying to be appealing to 13 year-olds.\\n\\nTotal cost of our pizzas, salad, 3 sodas, and tax = about $39.   \n",

This place is a home run! Remember that place salad work, maybe u don't it was particularly memorable! This is it's big bad stepbrother, the 2.0 X version  seriously this place is fantastico¡ Think of hip city veg but \"Just Salads\" Pon intended ‍. The place is clean from the bathroom to the front door. It's always neat/organized. The staff is great and the upper management is evolved in the day to day operations of the store. The food is yuuuuuummmm, get the Thai lettuce wraps OMG  my fav and the portion is perfect. Don't get me started on their smoothies ‍ ugh now I want one! Seriously and honestly the only and I mean only draw back is that I can't eat here every day bc I couldn't afford to. However, u get what u pay for it's totally worth it. I'm happy to spend my money here and not have a single complaint vs. going to a cheaper eatery and having a poor experience.   \n",

I never found any reason to go back due to the high prices, very limited space, and difficulty to reach from anywhere outside of East Nashville. And for an embarrassing reason, I ran into the Turnip Truck for a desperation beverage (spicy mouth), and for the moment I was there, it looked great.  Open, clean, modern: it was everything the East End version wasn't, except for the high prices.  The beverage selection was great, and I saw they had a barista bar, which intrigued me.  So when I recently had a free moment, I went back to give their coffees a shot. The verdict: outstanding but very expensive for a single latte.  I enjoyed the drink thoroughly, but was dismayed at the price.  The drink itself will haunt me whenever I go to the gulch, not because it was the best in town (but it was up there), but that even though it was really good, I just don't have the means to pay that much for such a small drink. If you're in the store, and you need a burst of energy, it will more than satisfy (and you're probably the type that can afford to shop there, anyway), but if you're tooling around between downtown and West End, get to Casablanca, it's just that much better.  \n",

The service is excellent, the servings are generous, the biscuits are perfect. Ed, the general manager,is good about checking on tables and is committed to serving his community. He can be seen giving out coffee to the homeless in the winter and helping them out in other ways as he can. I love supporting a restaurant with great food and a passion for the community.!  \n",
       "1257196  I wanted to love this place because of all the renovation work that had been done since it was Santorini, sadly it does not hold up to the hype. The exterior was inviting as was the interior, I felt like I was visiting the home of a Greek relative. The picture of the owner and his son as soon as I walked in almost ensured a fantastic meal, because it's the same owner as Mykonos across the Street, and their food is always fresh and imaginative. Service was good, our waitress worked hard, and we didn't have to wait, our issue was the food. I ordered the Thalassina which is a combination of chargrilled Octopus, squid, scallops, and shrimp. Being a seafood lover, and Greek, I expected the dish to be full of flavor, all I tasted was oil. It was cooked properly, not overdone, not raw, the taste however truly took away from the $22 dish. I sampled my wife's Greek salad which met every expectation desired for a Greek Salad, Crisp red tomatoes, Kalamata Olives that were plump not soft, lettuce that was so crisp, just hearing the crunch made my mouth water. The feta cheese was of a great quality as well. I sampled a bit of Chicken Souvlaki, and this was where my biggest upset was. The chicken was over cooked, and seasoned only with pepper, not marinated in lemon with traditional Greek seasonings, the Tzatziki took up the slack that the chicken left behind. I had only wished it was better. All in all I probably would not visit again, I would rather visit Mykonos, enjoy better food for a more economical price. Please fix this location, add some more creativity to the food, and a little more imagination.  \n",

I had a 6\" Maddy with mushrooms.  My daughters had an 11\" gluten-free crust with pepperoni, sausage, and hamburger, which they said was excellent. We also had a spinach and asiago salad.  Huge bowl. I had been to the Maryland Heights  location many times, but this location is better- there was pleasant background music instead of loud noise trying to be appealing to 13 year-olds. Total cost of our pizzas, salad, 3 sodas, and tax = about $39.  \n",

This place is a home run! Remember that place salad work, maybe u don't it was particularly memorable! This is it's big bad stepbrother, the 2.0 X version  seriously this place is fantastico¡ Think of hip city veg but \"Just Salads\" Pon intended ‍. The place is clean from the bathroom to the front door. It's always neat/organized. The staff is great and the upper management is evolved in the day to day operations of the store. The food is yuuuuuummmm, get the Thai lettuce wraps OMG  my fav and the portion is perfect. Don't get me started on their smoothies ‍ ugh now I want one! Seriously and honestly the only and I mean only draw back is that I can't eat here every day bc I couldn't afford to. However, u get what u pay for it's totally worth it. I'm happy to spend my money here and not have a single complaint vs. going to a cheaper eatery and having a poor experience.  \n",

Dinner was tasty but I'm giving Crabby's 5 stars because of our server, Caleb. Caleb spent time with us, giving detailed advice about the food, making recommendations and telling us about the area. His attentiveness and friendly demeanor made the dining experience exceptional.   \n",

I enjoyed the drink thoroughly, but was dismayed at the price.  The drink itself will haunt me whenever I go to the gulch, not because it was the best in town (but it was up there), but that even though it was really good, I just don't have the means to pay that much for such a small drink.\\n\\nIf you're in the store, and you need a burst of energy, it will more than satisfy (and you're probably the type that can afford to shop there, anyway), but if you're tooling around between downtown and West End, get to Casablanca, it's just that much better.   \n",

His attentiveness and friendly demeanor made the dining experience exceptional.   \n",

There was a great ambience about it...very cozy and dimly light, which is the type of atmosphere I search for when looking for restaurants to try. The staff were very friendly and were quick to give helpful opinions in ordering drinks and such. I first tried the sangria which was delicious. The bartender said it was their own special recipe with a secret ingredient. I definitely could taste something that made it different from other sangria I have tried, but couldn't quite put my finger on it. I also later ordered the house margarita....absolutely delicious and very fresh tasting. It is apparent that it is completely home made with fresh ingredients. We ordered the grilled calamari, garlic soup, rib eye, patatas, chorizo w/ manchego, brussel sprouts with pancetta and havarti cheese, fries, and lamb chops (TO DIE FOR).....don't cheat yourself....order extra lamb chops!) Everything was absolutely delicious. We ended our meal with espresso at the recommendation of our friends and it did not disappoint. The owner/chef (yes, the owner was in the kitchen cooking all of our food....you cant get any better than that) came out to greet us as we were finishing up which was very nice. He actually sat at the empty table next to us and we all talked about how he got started, how he built this establishment himself including the decor, plumbing and electric. His passion for cooking and his love/pride for his restaurant was very evident. We enjoyed the whole experience very much and will definitely visit again!</td>\n",

I now live in Jacksonville, where we have only two Peruvian restaurants. Cazador Grill is one of many Peruvian restaurants in Tampa. It is excellent. My husband and I shared ceviche, anticuchos, and sudado de pescado. All were beyond excellent; all were authentic. I highly recommend this restaurant to aficiandos of Peruvian cuisine or to anyone who wants to experience good food.   \n",
       "19244   I had the pleasure of visiting this restaurant last weekend with some friends who had been here before and highly recommended it. There was a great ambience about it...very cozy and dimly light, which is the type of atmosphere I search for when looking for restaurants to try. The staff were very friendly and were quick to give helpful opinions in ordering drinks and such. I first tried the sangria which was delicious. The bartender said it was their own special recipe with a secret ingredient. I definitely could taste something that made it different from other sangria I have tried, but couldn't quite put my finger on it. I also later ordered the house margarita....absolutely delicious and very fresh tasting. It is apparent that it is completely home made with fresh ingredients. We ordered the grilled calamari, garlic soup, rib eye, patatas, chorizo w/ manchego, brussel sprouts with pancetta and havarti cheese, fries, and lamb chops (TO DIE FOR).....don't cheat yourself....order extra lamb chops!) Everything was absolutely delicious. We ended our meal with espresso at the recommendation of our friends and it did not disappoint. The owner/chef (yes, the owner was in the kitchen cooking all of our food....you cant get any better than that) came out to greet us as we were finishing up which was very nice. He actually sat at the empty table next to us and we all talked about how he got started, how he built this establishment himself including the decor, plumbing and electric. His passion for cooking and his love/pride for his restaurant was very evident. We enjoyed the whole experience very much and will definitely visit again!   \n",

The Cascades Restaurant looks wonderful with gardens and flowing water every where.\\n$ Prices: High\\nFood quality:  3/5\\nAmbiance: 5/5\\nServer: 4/5\\nThe reason for the low score is the Cascade manager inhospitable accommodation toward my family.  With a virtually empty restaurant we were seated at a table for five with the sun shining in our faces.  When we asked the waiter for a new table he informed us after talking with the manager the other tables were reserved and we had to stay in sunny area.  We relented because the waiter was very nice and apologetic.  When we finished dinner and talked for a while an hour and half had passed since our arrival I noticed the restaurant attendance level had changed very little and tables we had asked to be moved to remained empty.  \\nIf you have a bigger family or have more than four in your group go somewhere else.  Four or less expect okay food at high prices with wonderful service and amazing ambiance.   \n",

       "19244   i had the pleasure of visiting this restaurant last weekend with some friends who had been here before and highly recommended it. there was a great ambience about it...very cozy and dimly light, which is the type of atmosphere i search for when looking for restaurants to try. the staff were very friendly and were quick to give helpful opinions in ordering drinks and such. i first tried the sangria which was delicious. the bartender said it was their own special recipe with a secret ingredient. i definitely could taste something that made it different from other sangria i have tried, but couldn't quite put my finger on it. i also later ordered the house margarita....absolutely delicious and very fresh tasting. it is apparent that it is completely home made with fresh ingredients. we ordered the grilled calamari, garlic soup, rib eye, patatas, chorizo w/ manchego, brussel sprouts with pancetta and havarti cheese, fries, and lamb chops (to die for).....don't cheat yourself....order extra lamb chops!) everything was absolutely delicious. we ended our meal with espresso at the recommendation of our friends and it did not disappoint. the owner/chef (yes, the owner was in the kitchen cooking all of our food....you cant get any better than that) came out to greet us as we were finishing up which was very nice. he actually sat at the empty table next to us and we all talked about how he got started, how he built this establishment himself including the decor, plumbing and electric. his passion for cooking and his love/pride for his restaurant was very evident. we enjoyed the whole experience very much and will definitely visit again!   \n",

       "16  i was prepared for an epic cafeteria line of food so i was kind of let down at the selection. i thought you got 2 sides w the meat then say the sign that said the sides were $1.99 each. so rookie mistake.   all is had an insane amount of food. my only complaint was my kids kept saying their mac n cheese tasted strange. i finally tasted it and it was very salty and i think there were onions in it. kind of a let down considering my one kid got a double order.  comparing this to somewhere like mcl i have to say you actually get a decent amount of food here.  we skipped dessert because we always wait to see how full we are and we were stuffed. but we did buy a frozen pie to go.  the kid that came to our table was great and always made sure our drinks were refilled.  for a meatloaf w 2 side, roast beef 2 sides, chicken tenders 2 sides and 3 vegetable plate. 1 roll and 3 drinks and 1 water it was around $45.   \n",

       "7   steadily going downhill! when we first started going here it was fun and busy, the food was great, and the service was spot on. we had been going once or twice a month. tonight, our server was actually very sweet but her ability to be a good server was in need of some improvement in some areas.  we ordered a bowl of french onion soup and the asian chicken salad with the dressing on the side for us to both split. she made a great suggestion to get 2 cups instead as it would be the same cost as a bowl since one cup of soup was an add on to the meal and then get another cup. we took the suggestion and it worked out great! the table next to us ordered the meatloaf and they had a coupon for buy one get one free. when they got the meatloaf it didn't taste as to their expectations. he asked the server what was in it and who made it? she said the food was part of a chain so it was not made in house. although the menu said it was homemade! when we got our salads they had the dressing already on it although we had asked them to put the dressing on the side and so she took the salads back. when she came back out with a new salads the lettuce was pretty gross and it was frozen!! we were both pretty disappointed with the salad. then there was a table that was seated a couple away from us that had been there before us asked another server if they could order. the server had forgotten all about them. there were not a lot of tables that she had to serve so it was a bit disappointing to see all the kitchen and front of the house mistakes.  anyway, our bill for the 2 cups of soup only came out to a little over $5. we gave her a nice tip though. unfortunately, we are not interested in going back anytime soon.   \n",

(why were we given sushi menus if it was unavailable?) so we looked over the menu again picked something very quick because who knows how long until she would come back. about 5mins before our food comes to the table she comes over and tell us the sushi is available now. we got all excited and was very happy since sushi is what we came there for, but she never came back to the table, our drinks stayed empty, the food once again was so great! i loved my penang curry! i'm just very upset about the service, it's going to take me a while before i go to this place.   \n",

       "8   i finally managed to find it in myself to step in here and try the latest fast food fried chicken place in town.  i've been to popeyes in the us so i was looking forward to enjoying a bite that is conveniently in town.  i made a dinner sized order for the family and waited for about 30 minutes.   i'm sure other people have had great experiences from this place, but the chicken i got here can only be described as so-so.  i did not have the juicy, tasty chicken i remembered, and my family reported a similar experience with their meals.  all i can say is that sometimes this restaurant puts out hits and misses, and that's the way it goes for a new place.  i did regret it though since i was holding out my \"cheat\" meal for this place.   while i waited, the lines of people were always steady.  there remains a lot of attention for this business and you'll find yourself in good company while your wait for your order.  in the back, you can see a battalion of staffers running around.  i haven't seen a fast food joint so fully staffed like this one.  before you receive your order, there's a staff member closely checking your order to make sure you have everything and then you're all set.  make sure you take your time leaving this place because there will be a lot of people between you and the door.   \n",

(your steak comes with salad, bread, french onion soup, and potato, very reasonably priced for including so much).  they get their beef from omaha; which is not where the best beef comes from.  nice experience overall, however please do not think this will be the best steak of your life.  i really don't know how it made the list of one of the top steakhouses in the united states, very puzzling!  oh and the dessert room, really creepy, looks like a mob movie where someone would get bumped off!!!   \n",

       "1     i had the pleasure of visiting this restaurant last weekend with some friends who had been here before and highly recommended it. there was a great ambience about it...very cozy and dimly light, which is the type of atmosphere i search for when looking for restaurants to try. the staff were very friendly and were quick to give helpful opinions in ordering drinks and such. i first tried the sangria which was delicious. the bartender said it was their own special recipe with a secret ingredient. i definitely could taste something that made it different from other sangria i have tried, but couldn't quite put my finger on it. i also later ordered the house margarita....absolutely delicious and very fresh tasting. it is apparent that it is completely home made with fresh ingredients. we ordered the grilled calamari, garlic soup, rib eye, patatas, chorizo w/ manchego, brussel sprouts with pancetta and havarti cheese, fries, and lamb chops (to die for).....don't cheat yourself....order extra lamb chops!) everything was absolutely delicious. we ended our meal with espresso at the recommendation of our friends and it did not disappoint. the owner/chef (yes, the owner was in the kitchen cooking all of our food....you cant get any better than that) came out to greet us as we were finishing up which was very nice. he actually sat at the empty table next to us and we all talked about how he got started, how he built this establishment himself including the decor, plumbing and electric. his passion for cooking and his love/pride for his restaurant was very evident. we enjoyed the whole experience very much and will definitely visit again!   \n",

       "      <td>i had the pleasure of visiting this restaurant last weekend with some friends who had been here before and highly recommended it. there was a great ambience about it...very cozy and dimly light, which is the type of atmosphere i search for when looking for restaurants to try. the staff were very friendly and were quick to give helpful opinions in ordering drinks and such. i first tried the sangria which was delicious. the bartender said it was their own special recipe with a secret ingredient. i definitely could taste something that made it different from other sangria i have tried, but couldn't quite put my finger on it. i also later ordered the house margarita....absolutely delicious and very fresh tasting. it is apparent that it is completely home made with fresh ingredients. we ordered the grilled calamari, garlic soup, rib eye, patatas, chorizo w/ manchego, brussel sprouts with pancetta and havarti cheese, fries, and lamb chops (to die for).....don't cheat yourself....order extra lamb chops!) everything was absolutely delicious. we ended our meal with espresso at the recommendation of our friends and it did not disappoint. the owner/chef (yes, the owner was in the kitchen cooking all of our food....you cant get any better than that) came out to greet us as we were finishing up which was very nice. he actually sat at the empty table next to us and we all talked about how he got started, how he built this establishment himself including the decor, plumbing and electric. his passion for cooking and his love/pride for his restaurant was very evident. we enjoyed the whole experience very much and will definitely visit again!</td>\n",

       "      <td>we had been looking forward to visiting and staying at the gaylord opryland for months.  the cascades restaurant looks wonderful with gardens and flowing water every where.$ prices: highfood quality:  3/5ambiance: 5/5server: 4/5the reason for the low score is the cascade manager inhospitable accommodation toward my family.  with a virtually empty restaurant we were seated at a table for five with the sun shining in our faces.  when we asked the waiter for a new table he informed us after talking with the manager the other tables were reserved and we had to stay in sunny area.  we relented because the waiter was very nice and apologetic.  when we finished dinner and talked for a while an hour and half had passed since our arrival i noticed the restaurant attendance level had changed very little and tables we had asked to be moved to remained empty.  if you have a bigger family or have more than four in your group go somewhere else.  four or less expect okay food at high prices with wonderful service and amazing ambiance.</td>\n",

       "1     i had the pleasure of visiting this restaurant last weekend with some friends who had been here before and highly recommended it. there was a great ambience about it...very cozy and dimly light, which is the type of atmosphere i search for when looking for restaurants to try. the staff were very friendly and were quick to give helpful opinions in ordering drinks and such. i first tried the sangria which was delicious. the bartender said it was their own special recipe with a secret ingredient. i definitely could taste something that made it different from other sangria i have tried, but couldn't quite put my finger on it. i also later ordered the house margarita....absolutely delicious and very fresh tasting. it is apparent that it is completely home made with fresh ingredients. we ordered the grilled calamari, garlic soup, rib eye, patatas, chorizo w/ manchego, brussel sprouts with pancetta and havarti cheese, fries, and lamb chops (to die for).....don't cheat yourself....order extra lamb chops!) everything was absolutely delicious. we ended our meal with espresso at the recommendation of our friends and it did not disappoint. the owner/chef (yes, the owner was in the kitchen cooking all of our food....you cant get any better than that) came out to greet us as we were finishing up which was very nice. he actually sat at the empty table next to us and we all talked about how he got started, how he built this establishment himself including the decor, plumbing and electric. his passion for cooking and his love/pride for his restaurant was very evident. we enjoyed the whole experience very much and will definitely visit again!   \n",

       "0               we had been looking forward to visiting and staying at the gaylord opryland for months.  the cascades restaurant looks wonderful with gardens and flowing water every where.$ prices: highfood quality:  3/5ambiance: 5/5server: 4/5the reason for the low score is the cascade manager inhospitable accommodation toward my family.  with a virtually empty restaurant we were seated at a table for five with the sun shining in our faces.  when we asked the waiter for a new table he informed us after talking with the manager the other tables were reserved and we had to stay in sunny area.  we relented because the waiter was very nice and apologetic.  when we finished dinner and talked for a while an hour and half had passed since our arrival i noticed the restaurant attendance level had changed very little and tables we had asked to be moved to remained empty.  if you have a bigger family or have more than four in your group go somewhere else.  four or less expect okay food at high prices with wonderful service and amazing ambiance.   \n",

       "5  i am not sure if the staff first goes over to the slot machines in the airport to lose their money before their shift to hate life so much, maybe it is just their nature or they are just poorly managed. i only had a beer at the bar but it was directly next to the kitchen. the amount of complaining that comes out of this wait staff is amazing. he was not my server but based on the nose in the sky and filthy language used - if you see ricky come up to your table you should quit there and stop by mcdonald's next door. they all smile when the are next to me talking to each other but mostly because they appear to bound together to hate on everything and everyone in this restaurant.  i am so happy i do not need to go through this airport often and even happier i was not hungry when i sat down. the food that is passed behind me looks like you would eat it only if you had no other choice.  i would give another star for their beer selection (nice local taps) but it got knocked back down to one to make a point to avoid this place at any cost.   \n",

       "1     i had the pleasure of visiting this restaurant last weekend with some friends who had been here before and highly recommended it. there was a great ambience about it...very cozy and dimly light, which is the type of atmosphere i search for when looking for restaurants to try. the staff were very friendly and were quick to give helpful opinions in ordering drinks and such. i first tried the sangria which was delicious. the bartender said it was their own special recipe with a secret ingredient. i definitely could taste something that made it different from other sangria i have tried, but couldn't quite put my finger on it. i also later ordered the house margarita....absolutely delicious and very fresh tasting. it is apparent that it is completely home made with fresh ingredients. we ordered the grilled calamari, garlic soup, rib eye, patatas, chorizo w/ manchego, brussel sprouts with pancetta and havarti cheese, fries, and lamb chops (to die for).....don't cheat yourself....order extra lamb chops!) everything was absolutely delicious. we ended our meal with espresso at the recommendation of our friends and it did not disappoint. the owner/chef (yes, the owner was in the kitchen cooking all of our food....you cant get any better than that) came out to greet us as we were finishing up which was very nice. he actually sat at the empty table next to us and we all talked about how he got started, how he built this establishment himself including the decor, plumbing and electric. his passion for cooking and his love/pride for his restaurant was very evident. we enjoyed the whole experience very much and will definitely visit again!   \n",

    "High negative and high positive ratios correspond with neg/pos sentiments. Review sentiment composition gets murky with neutral sentiment since a neutral stance with a restaurant can have a bunch of negative or neutral comments. Would need to look at star rating to get a better view of what sentiment is majority in neutral classified reviews. Let's take a quick peek."

       "8  just tried take out from here last night.  i ordered the tom yum soup, drunken noodles and pad thai.  the tom yum soup was decently prepared but the only flavor that stood out was sweetness. a great tom yum soup is very fragrant and flavorful and contains sour and sweet flavors combined.  this soup also had an abidance of jalapeño peppers swimming around and only 4-5 shrimp for a large soup.  i was a tad disappointed.  the pad thai was decent and they gave a large portion, but it was a little on the dry side and i was unsure where all the seafood went as i only found two calamari and 3 shrimp in the entire dish.  the drunken noodles were a disappointment.  there was barely any sauce on them and they stuck together in giant clumps.  the seafood factor was also lacking.  overall, it was an ok experience.  i was hungry and craving thai, and was not able to drive a further distance, therefore for what i needed it satisfied my hunger. however, i do not think i would go out of my way to dine at this restaurant according to the dishes i had.   \n",

Red bean-filled buns, mung bean-filled buns, coconut stuff, egg tarts etc.  If you buy a dozen, they will give you two more for free.  The prices are standard for a Chinese bakery, with most things at approximately $1.  The service has always been good.  They do serve coffee and tea.  There are a couple of tables inside, with usually the expected group of older Chinese guys chillin' in the corner table debating about something.  Great place to stock up on the buns, which I usually do before leaving town.</td>\n",

I think we might have tried it once a year or two ago, but it wasn't memorable.  I decided to try the HK-style milk tea not too long ago and was hooked.  I think I went here almost every day one week to get the milk tea, only to realize that I should REALLY watch my sugar intake...it's sooo good!  \\n\\nI personally don't think it's better than Zhong Gang's HK-style milk tea because they have their off days when a certain lady makes them (not enough ice, too much ice, etc.).\\n\\nOn a side note:  I wanted to try the crispy roast pork bun, but accidentally said the wrong name in Chinese and got the roast pork bun.  It was decent enough, although I will get to trying the crispy roast pork bun soon!  \\n\\nI will be back~</td>\n",

They have a decent variety of buns and pastries.  Red bean-filled buns, mung bean-filled buns, coconut stuff, egg tarts etc.  If you buy a dozen, they will give you two more for free.  The prices are standard for a Chinese bakery, with most things at approximately $1.  The service has always been good.  They do serve coffee and tea.  There are a couple of tables inside, with usually the expected group of older Chinese guys chillin' in the corner table debating about something.  Great place to stock up on the buns, which I usually do before leaving town.   \n",

       "4  HK-STYLE MILK TEA:  FOUR STARS\\n\\nNot quite sure why there are two Saint Honore Pastries business listings on Yelp, but I have been checking in to this one.\\n\\nBoyfriend and I go by it all the time while in Chinatown, but it never crossed our mind to try it.  I think we might have tried it once a year or two ago, but it wasn't memorable.  I decided to try the HK-style milk tea not too long ago and was hooked.  I think I went here almost every day one week to get the milk tea, only to realize that I should REALLY watch my sugar intake...it's sooo good!  \\n\\nI personally don't think it's better than Zhong Gang's HK-style milk tea because they have their off days when a certain lady makes them (not enough ice, too much ice, etc.).\\n\\nOn a side note:  I wanted to try the crispy roast pork bun, but accidentally said the wrong name in Chinese and got the roast pork bun.  It was decent enough, although I will get to trying the crispy roast pork bun soon!  \\n\\nI will be back~   \n",

       "7  just tried take out from here last night.  i ordered the tom yum soup, drunken noodles and pad thai.  the tom yum soup was decently prepared but the only flavor that stood out was sweetness. a great tom yum soup is very fragrant and flavorful and contains sour and sweet flavors combined.  this soup also had an abidance of jalapeño peppers swimming around and only 4-5 shrimp for a large soup.  i was a tad disappointed.  the pad thai was decent and they gave a large portion, but it was a little on the dry side and i was unsure where all the seafood went as i only found two calamari and 3 shrimp in the entire dish.  the drunken noodles were a disappointment.  there was barely any sauce on them and they stuck together in giant clumps.  the seafood factor was also lacking.  overall, it was an ok experience.  i was hungry and craving thai, and was not able to drive a further distance, therefore for what i needed it satisfied my hunger. however, i do not think i would go out of my way to dine at this restaurant according to the dishes i had.   \n",

       "      <td>el merendero got it's start as an a&amp;w restaurant in 1965, but today, it's one of the best mexican restaurants on south 12th avenue.  i had dinner here with the family and two of my son's friends tonight. if you happen to be in the area, el merendero is definitely worth a visit. i had the chile rellenos, and they were some of the best i've ever had! very spicy &amp; delicious, and for $7.99- hard to beat. they come with rice and beans, and a small side of chopped lettuce. as an appetizer, we shared an order of guacamole for the table. it came with chips and a small side of pico de gallo for $4.99. sort of pricey for a small side of guacamole, but none of us were disappointed, as the chips and salsa were free.  the other members of our party either had rolled tacos, hard shell tacos, or soft shell tacos. you can't go wrong with any of these choices. this place is clean, casual, friendly, and overall reasonably priced. they also have numerous seafood options on the menu, including mexican fish and shrimp cocktails, even oysters- though none of us was feeling quite so adventurous as to try one of the seafood cocktails or dishes.  as i said, if you're in the area- this place is definitely worth trying... be aware that for parties of 6 or more, they do add on the tip. our check, with tax and (added on) gratuity came to $85 for a party of 6. we each had a beverage ($2.25 for horchata and $1.99 for soft drinks), and no one had dessert.  overall, the food is very good, but in my opinion- prices are a tad high for the location. this was a totally enjoyable casual dining experience- one worth putting on your tucson mexican food to try list.</td>\n",

(me)today, being takeout only due to covid-19, i was so pleasantly surprised to find wonderful service and great food when i got home!i ordered pescadaro frita, a whole fish deep fried with seasoned salt. it came with salad, fries, rice, halved limes, and tortillas. everything was wrapped up right and with thought and detail. very much appreciated. an incredible deal at under $20 and very delicious!   \n",

       "6  el merendero got it's start as an a&w restaurant in 1965, but today, it's one of the best mexican restaurants on south 12th avenue.  i had dinner here with the family and two of my son's friends tonight. if you happen to be in the area, el merendero is definitely worth a visit. i had the chile rellenos, and they were some of the best i've ever had! very spicy & delicious, and for $7.99- hard to beat. they come with rice and beans, and a small side of chopped lettuce. as an appetizer, we shared an order of guacamole for the table. it came with chips and a small side of pico de gallo for $4.99. sort of pricey for a small side of guacamole, but none of us were disappointed, as the chips and salsa were free.  the other members of our party either had rolled tacos, hard shell tacos, or soft shell tacos. you can't go wrong with any of these choices. this place is clean, casual, friendly, and overall reasonably priced. they also have numerous seafood options on the menu, including mexican fish and shrimp cocktails, even oysters- though none of us was feeling quite so adventurous as to try one of the seafood cocktails or dishes.  as i said, if you're in the area- this place is definitely worth trying... be aware that for parties of 6 or more, they do add on the tip. our check, with tax and (added on) gratuity came to $85 for a party of 6. we each had a beverage ($2.25 for horchata and $1.99 for soft drinks), and no one had dessert.  overall, the food is very good, but in my opinion- prices are a tad high for the location. this was a totally enjoyable casual dining experience- one worth putting on your tucson mexican food to try list.   \n",

       "6   el merendero got it's start as an a&w restaurant in 1965, but today, it's one of the best mexican restaurants on south 12th avenue.  i had dinner here with the family and two of my son's friends tonight. if you happen to be in the area, el merendero is definitely worth a visit. i had the chile rellenos, and they were some of the best i've ever had! very spicy & delicious, and for $7.99- hard to beat. they come with rice and beans, and a small side of chopped lettuce. as an appetizer, we shared an order of guacamole for the table. it came with chips and a small side of pico de gallo for $4.99. sort of pricey for a small side of guacamole, but none of us were disappointed, as the chips and salsa were free.  the other members of our party either had rolled tacos, hard shell tacos, or soft shell tacos. you can't go wrong with any of these choices. this place is clean, casual, friendly, and overall reasonably priced. they also have numerous seafood options on the menu, including mexican fish and shrimp cocktails, even oysters- though none of us was feeling quite so adventurous as to try one of the seafood cocktails or dishes.  as i said, if you're in the area- this place is definitely worth trying... be aware that for parties of 6 or more, they do add on the tip. our check, with tax and (added on) gratuity came to $85 for a party of 6. we each had a beverage ($2.25 for horchata and $1.99 for soft drinks), and no one had dessert.  overall, the food is very good, but in my opinion- prices are a tad high for the location. this was a totally enjoyable casual dining experience- one worth putting on your tucson mexican food to try list.   \n",

       "6   el merendero got it is start as an aandw restaurant in 1965 but today it is one of the best mexican restaurants on south 12th avenue  i had dinner here with the family and two of my sons friends tonight if you happen to be in the area el merendero is definitely worth a visit i had the chile rellenos and they were some of the best I have ever had very spicy and delicious and for 799 dollars hard to beat they come with rice and beans and a small side of chopped lettuce as an appetizer we shared an order of guacamole for the table it came with chips and a small side of pico de gallo for 499 dollars sort of pricey for a small side of guacamole but none of us were disappointed as the chips and salsa were free  the other members of our party either had rolled tacos hard shell tacos or soft shell tacos you cannot go wrong with any of these choices this place is clean casual friendly and overall reasonably priced they also have numerous seafood options on the menu including mexican fish and shrimp cocktails even oysters though none of us was feeling quite so adventurous as to try one of the seafood cocktails or dishes  as i said if you are in the area this place is definitely worth trying be aware that for parties of 6 or more they do add on the tip our check with tax and added on gratuity came to 850 dollars for a party of 6 we each had a beverage 225 dollars for horchata and 199 dollars for soft drinks and no one had dessert  overall the food is very good but in my opinion prices are a tad high for the location this was a totally enjoyable casual dining experience one worth putting on your tucson mexican food to try list   \n",

       "6   el merendero got it's start as an a&w restaurant in 1965, but today, it's one of the best mexican restaurants on south 12th avenue.  i had dinner here with the family and two of my son's friends tonight. if you happen to be in the area, el merendero is definitely worth a visit. i had the chile rellenos, and they were some of the best i've ever had! very spicy & delicious, and for $7.99- hard to beat. they come with rice and beans, and a small side of chopped lettuce. as an appetizer, we shared an order of guacamole for the table. it came with chips and a small side of pico de gallo for $4.99. sort of pricey for a small side of guacamole, but none of us were disappointed, as the chips and salsa were free.  the other members of our party either had rolled tacos, hard shell tacos, or soft shell tacos. you can't go wrong with any of these choices. this place is clean, casual, friendly, and overall reasonably priced. they also have numerous seafood options on the menu, including mexican fish and shrimp cocktails, even oysters- though none of us was feeling quite so adventurous as to try one of the seafood cocktails or dishes.  as i said, if you're in the area- this place is definitely worth trying... be aware that for parties of 6 or more, they do add on the tip. our check, with tax and (added on) gratuity came to $85 for a party of 6. we each had a beverage ($2.25 for horchata and $1.99 for soft drinks), and no one had dessert.  overall, the food is very good, but in my opinion- prices are a tad high for the location. this was a totally enjoyable casual dining experience- one worth putting on your tucson mexican food to try list.   \n",

       "6   el merendero got it is start as an aandw restaurant in 1965 but today it is one of the best mexican restaurants on south 12th avenue  i had dinner here with the family and two of my sons friends tonight if you happen to be in the area el merendero is definitely worth a visit i had the chile rellenos and they were some of the best I have ever had very spicy and delicious and for 799 dollars hard to beat they come with rice and beans and a small side of chopped lettuce as an appetizer we shared an order of guacamole for the table it came with chips and a small side of pico de gallo for 499 dollars sort of pricey for a small side of guacamole but none of us were disappointed as the chips and salsa were free  the other members of our party either had rolled tacos hard shell tacos or soft shell tacos you cannot go wrong with any of these choices this place is clean casual friendly and overall reasonably priced they also have numerous seafood options on the menu including mexican fish and shrimp cocktails even oysters though none of us was feeling quite so adventurous as to try one of the seafood cocktails or dishes  as i said if you are in the area this place is definitely worth trying be aware that for parties of 6 or more they do add on the tip our check with tax and added on gratuity came to 850 dollars for a party of 6 we each had a beverage 225 dollars for horchata and 199 dollars for soft drinks and no one had dessert  overall the food is very good but in my opinion prices are a tad high for the location this was a totally enjoyable casual dining experience one worth putting on your tucson mexican food to try list   \n",

       "      <td>el merendero got it's start as an a&amp;w restaurant in 1965, but today, it's one of the best mexican restaurants on south 12th avenue.  i had dinner here with the family and two of my son's friends tonight. if you happen to be in the area, el merendero is definitely worth a visit. i had the chile rellenos, and they were some of the best i've ever had! very spicy &amp; delicious, and for $7.99- hard to beat. they come with rice and beans, and a small side of chopped lettuce. as an appetizer, we shared an order of guacamole for the table. it came with chips and a small side of pico de gallo for $4.99. sort of pricey for a small side of guacamole, but none of us were disappointed, as the chips and salsa were free.  the other members of our party either had rolled tacos, hard shell tacos, or soft shell tacos. you can't go wrong with any of these choices. this place is clean, casual, friendly, and overall reasonably priced. they also have numerous seafood options on the menu, including mexican fish and shrimp cocktails, even oysters- though none of us was feeling quite so adventurous as to try one of the seafood cocktails or dishes.  as i said, if you're in the area- this place is definitely worth trying... be aware that for parties of 6 or more, they do add on the tip. our check, with tax and (added on) gratuity came to $85 for a party of 6. we each had a beverage ($2.25 for horchata and $1.99 for soft drinks), and no one had dessert.  overall, the food is very good, but in my opinion- prices are a tad high for the location. this was a totally enjoyable casual dining experience- one worth putting on your tucson mexican food to try list.</td>\n",

       "6   el merendero got it's start as an a&w restaurant in 1965, but today, it's one of the best mexican restaurants on south 12th avenue.  i had dinner here with the family and two of my son's friends tonight. if you happen to be in the area, el merendero is definitely worth a visit. i had the chile rellenos, and they were some of the best i've ever had! very spicy & delicious, and for $7.99- hard to beat. they come with rice and beans, and a small side of chopped lettuce. as an appetizer, we shared an order of guacamole for the table. it came with chips and a small side of pico de gallo for $4.99. sort of pricey for a small side of guacamole, but none of us were disappointed, as the chips and salsa were free.  the other members of our party either had rolled tacos, hard shell tacos, or soft shell tacos. you can't go wrong with any of these choices. this place is clean, casual, friendly, and overall reasonably priced. they also have numerous seafood options on the menu, including mexican fish and shrimp cocktails, even oysters- though none of us was feeling quite so adventurous as to try one of the seafood cocktails or dishes.  as i said, if you're in the area- this place is definitely worth trying... be aware that for parties of 6 or more, they do add on the tip. our check, with tax and (added on) gratuity came to $85 for a party of 6. we each had a beverage ($2.25 for horchata and $1.99 for soft drinks), and no one had dessert.  overall, the food is very good, but in my opinion- prices are a tad high for the location. this was a totally enjoyable casual dining experience- one worth putting on your tucson mexican food to try list.   \n",

       "6   el merendero got it is start as an aandw restaurant in 1965 but today it is one of the best mexican restaurants on south 12th avenue  i had dinner here with the family and two of my sons friends tonight if you happen to be in the area el merendero is definitely worth a visit i had the chile rellenos and they were some of the best I have ever had very spicy and delicious and for 799 dollars hard to beat they come with rice and beans and a small side of chopped lettuce as an appetizer we shared an order of guacamole for the table it came with chips and a small side of pico de gallo for 499 dollars sort of pricey for a small side of guacamole but none of us were disappointed as the chips and salsa were free  the other members of our party either had rolled tacos hard shell tacos or soft shell tacos you cannot go wrong with any of these choices this place is clean casual friendly and overall reasonably priced they also have numerous seafood options on the menu including mexican fish and shrimp cocktails even oysters though none of us was feeling quite so adventurous as to try one of the seafood cocktails or dishes  as i said if you are in the area this place is definitely worth trying be aware that for parties of 6 or more they do add on the tip our check with tax and added on gratuity came to 850 dollars for a party of 6 we each had a beverage 225 dollars for horchata and 199 dollars for soft drinks and no one had dessert  overall the food is very good but in my opinion prices are a tad high for the location this was a totally enjoyable casual dining experience one worth putting on your tucson mexican food to try list   \n",

       "6   el merendero got it's start as an a&w restaurant in 1965, but today, it's one of the best mexican restaurants on south 12th avenue.  i had dinner here with the family and two of my son's friends tonight. if you happen to be in the area, el merendero is definitely worth a visit. i had the chile rellenos, and they were some of the best i've ever had! very spicy & delicious, and for $7.99- hard to beat. they come with rice and beans, and a small side of chopped lettuce. as an appetizer, we shared an order of guacamole for the table. it came with chips and a small side of pico de gallo for $4.99. sort of pricey for a small side of guacamole, but none of us were disappointed, as the chips and salsa were free.  the other members of our party either had rolled tacos, hard shell tacos, or soft shell tacos. you can't go wrong with any of these choices. this place is clean, casual, friendly, and overall reasonably priced. they also have numerous seafood options on the menu, including mexican fish and shrimp cocktails, even oysters- though none of us was feeling quite so adventurous as to try one of the seafood cocktails or dishes.  as i said, if you're in the area- this place is definitely worth trying... be aware that for parties of 6 or more, they do add on the tip. our check, with tax and (added on) gratuity came to $85 for a party of 6. we each had a beverage ($2.25 for horchata and $1.99 for soft drinks), and no one had dessert.  overall, the food is very good, but in my opinion- prices are a tad high for the location. this was a totally enjoyable casual dining experience- one worth putting on your tucson mexican food to try list.   \n",

       "6   el merendero got it is start as an aandw restaurant in 1965 but today it is one of the best mexican restaurants on south 12th avenue  i had dinner here with the family and two of my sons friends tonight if you happen to be in the area el merendero is definitely worth a visit i had the chile rellenos and they were some of the best I have ever had very spicy and delicious and for 799 dollars hard to beat they come with rice and beans and a small side of chopped lettuce as an appetizer we shared an order of guacamole for the table it came with chips and a small side of pico de gallo for 499 dollars sort of pricey for a small side of guacamole but none of us were disappointed as the chips and salsa were free  the other members of our party either had rolled tacos hard shell tacos or soft shell tacos you cannot go wrong with any of these choices this place is clean casual friendly and overall reasonably priced they also have numerous seafood options on the menu including mexican fish and shrimp cocktails even oysters though none of us was feeling quite so adventurous as to try one of the seafood cocktails or dishes  as i said if you are in the area this place is definitely worth trying be aware that for parties of 6 or more they do add on the tip our check with tax and added on gratuity came to 850 dollars for a party of 6 we each had a beverage 225 dollars for horchata and 199 dollars for soft drinks and no one had dessert  overall the food is very good but in my opinion prices are a tad high for the location this was a totally enjoyable casual dining experience one worth putting on your tucson mexican food to try list   \n",

       "0  [el jarocho is exactly what i need in a taco place i will never turn down free chips and salsa and it is a great way to start off for those who are more mild salsa fans the complimentary salsa does have quite a kick  the service was very friendly and quick for having such an elaborate menu i was impressed with how quickly our food was delivered to our table i went for the steak tacos and was delighted the portions were generous and the tacos were hefty with three per order it was a solid meal for under 100 dollars  there is a limited amount of seating  so this would not be the place for groups larger than 6 especially during the dinner rush i will definitely be returning whether for dinein or takeout  I am happy to know of this quality mexican food establishment, not sure if the tacos are not as good as before or if i have higher expectations for tacos now but the place is still pretty good just not great they have great atmosphere and still love their chips and guacamole, el merendero got it is start as an aandw restaurant in 1965 but today it is one of the best mexican restaurants on south 12th avenue  i had dinner here with the family and two of my sons friends tonight if you happen to be in the area el merendero is definitely worth a visit i had the chile rellenos and they were some of the best I have ever had very spicy and delicious and for 799 dollars hard to beat they come with rice and beans and a small side of chopped lettuce as an appetizer we shared an order of guacamole for the table it came with chips and a small side of pico de gallo for 499 dollars sort of pricey for a small side of guacamole but none of us were disappointed as the chips and salsa were free  the other members of our party either had rolled tacos hard shell tacos or soft shell tacos you cannot go wrong with any of these choices this place is clean casual friendly and overall reasonably priced they also have numerous seafood options on the menu including mexican fish and shrimp cocktails even oysters though none of us was feeling quite so adventurous as to try one of the seafood cocktails or dishes  as i said if you are in the area this place is definitely worth trying be aware that for parties of 6 or more they do add on the tip our check with tax and added on gratuity came to 850 dollars for a party of 6 we each had a beverage 225 dollars for horchata and 199 dollars for soft drinks and no one had dessert  overall the food is very good but in my opinion prices are a tad high for the location this was a totally enjoyable casual dining experience one worth putting on your tucson mexican food to try list]  "

       "      <td>[someone had recommended this restaurant so my husband and i decided to give it a try after being seated we looked around and many people were leaving a lot of food on the plates that is a big question to ask yourself when waiters pick up plates with food we started out with halibut ceviche and the fish was smelly and did not taste good so we asked the waiter if we can get something else and he said we must pay for it that is terrible service we left without ordering entrees because that is rude had we stayed the food might have tasted good but the service made us unhappy i have never been to a restaurant where a waiter would not take the food back, ate here for the first time on a friday night place was busy and we are told to expect a 30 minute wait for the 2 of us  we sat at the bar and ordered a drink bartender was great and extremely helpful explaining the menu because they have a lot of options  we were seated within 20 minutes and had arguably the best server we have had in any restaurant in the area bold statement i know but i stand by it we ordered right away and food took a bit longer than expected but drinks and chipssalsa did not go empty we had the fajitas and they were pretty good took leftovers home for the next and they were even better as mentioned in other posts the floors were slippery and the placement of the table pedal stool was awkward but to complain any more about it would be just being picky  we had an enjoyable experience and will be going back soon the only real recommendation i have for the food is for them to walk across the street and get the flour tortilla recipe from chevys as this place has some work to do on theirs, passing through and trying to find a mexican food breakfast yelp led us here with pretty substantial reviews  warning this a covid review where all dining is outdoors it was also during a dreadful heat wave for the coastal area  we were seated and provided a simple listed menu no descriptions of the plate but just a list covid menu  to my disappointment none of the food menu items were remotely near breakfast items pretty much a lunch and dinner condensed menu we waited sometime for a waitress to arrive to take a drink order upon returning with drinks the waitress scurried off and left for a good deal of time after approximately 15 minutes the waitress returned destined that i was slated to resort to lunch items the waitress said they had breakfast items available of what a relief  the waitress explained about the covid menu issues and they could not put breakfast items on the menu as to cut down on the amount of menus and the process of cleaning after each customer  the comment seemed like convenience over quality and tad bit lazy on the staffs part  but oh well at least she rattled off their additional choices for breakfast i opted with the machaca and papas and found it to be delicious with the right amount of shredded beef eggsveggies and chilies  my wife opted for the huevos rancheros with her eggs cooked over easy  she found the eggs to be fully cooked and the yolk hard and the chili verde sauce to be much sweeter than she liked  i too did not care for the chile verde sauce  this is probably is a decent place to get a meal but on this trip it felt as it definitely missed the mark i also seemed as the staff were lack luster and did not pay much attention to their customers]</td>\n",

       "1  [wow that is  all i can say the tacos here are the bomb dot com so tasty and packed with flavor i tried basically all the tacos in the menu and i gotta say my favorite one was one that was not in the menuthe barbacoa taco it had the perfect amount of spice and salt and texture and i just loved the way all the flavors came together I am not sure why the barbacoa was not on the menu but it was recommended by the waiter taking our order if you want some extra spice make sure to ask for the green sauce i was sweating from the spiciness but it tasted so good laugh out loud  i thought the steak taco was a little toooo salty but other than that all the rest of the tacos were spot on  i also really love the small cozy hole in the wall atmosphere with the beautiful painting on the wall highly recommended if you want to try some delicious and relatively cheap tacos d, we stopped at superrica vefore a show at the santa monica bowl and I am glad we did  after reading many of the reviews here i knew this was the place in sb for a preconcert meal we were not sure how much to order but knew that we needed to try an assortment of dishes to get various tastes as flavor  we had chorizo tacos  we had a daily special beef taco with guacamole on the side  we had a fish tamal the 16 superrica especial and one other plate  the tamal was wonderful and very tasty and had a rich cream sauce on top the fish almost tasted like shrimp but it was a fish memorable  the sr especial included marinated pork roasted pasilla pepper and melted cheese and 3 homemadehandmadefresh corn tortillas which are made while you wait that plate was generous with the meat and pepper and well flavored although the fresh pico de gallo added more flavor  everything was great the line out the door moved at a decent pace and it took less time to get out order after we placed it than i expected   beer is cheap  i was disappoited that the watermelon agua fresca had run out  the smiling counterman who took our prder and money mentioned the horchata as a possible alternative and ibtried it for the first time in my life  it was refreshing and sweet and can only be described as liquid rice pudding probably too sweet for many repeats for me but it was good in the moment   I would stop back anytime i was near santa barbara because the food was great the price was right great value for the money the experience was fun and the portions were just right   if la superrica has gone downhill over time or is just resting on its laurels and julia childs history of visits many years ago before she died it must have been amazingly awesome then because it is pretty awesome now, el merendero got it is start as an aandw restaurant in 1965 but today it is one of the best mexican restaurants on south 12th avenue  i had dinner here with the family and two of my sons friends tonight if you happen to be in the area el merendero is definitely worth a visit i had the chile rellenos and they were some of the best I have ever had very spicy and delicious and for 799 dollars hard to beat they come with rice and beans and a small side of chopped lettuce as an appetizer we shared an order of guacamole for the table it came with chips and a small side of pico de gallo for 499 dollars sort of pricey for a small side of guacamole but none of us were disappointed as the chips and salsa were free  the other members of our party either had rolled tacos hard shell tacos or soft shell tacos you cannot go wrong with any of these choices this place is clean casual friendly and overall reasonably priced they also have numerous seafood options on the menu including mexican fish and shrimp cocktails even oysters though none of us was feeling quite so adventurous as to try one of the seafood cocktails or dishes  as i said if you are in the area this place is definitely worth trying be aware that for parties of 6 or more they do add on the tip our check with tax and added on gratuity came to 850 dollars for a party of 6 we each had a beverage 225 dollars for horchata and 199 dollars for soft drinks and no one had dessert  overall the food is very good but in my opinion prices are a tad high for the location this was a totally enjoyable casual dining experience one worth putting on your tucson mexican food to try list]  \n",
