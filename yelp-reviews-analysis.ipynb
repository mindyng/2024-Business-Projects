I think I went here almost every day one week to get the milk tea, only to realize that I should REALLY watch my sugar intake...it's sooo good!  \\n\\nI personally don't think it's better than Zhong Gang's HK-style milk tea because they have their off days when a certain lady makes them (not enough ice, too much ice, etc.).\\n\\nOn a side note:  I wanted to try the crispy roast pork bun, but accidentally said the wrong name in Chinese and got the roast pork bun.  It was decent enough, although I will get to trying the crispy roast pork bun soon!  \\n\\nI will be back~</td>\n",

The female cashier was very friendly (flirtatious!) and the pastries shown in nicely adorned display cases. I stopped by early one evening had a sesame ball, which was filled with bean paste. The glutinous rice of the ball was nicely flavored, similar to Bai Tang Gao. Definitely as place worth stopping at if you are in the area.   \n",

They have a decent variety of buns and pastries.  Red bean-filled buns, mung bean-filled buns, coconut stuff, egg tarts etc.  If you buy a dozen, they will give you two more for free.  The prices are standard for a Chinese bakery, with most things at approximately $1.  The service has always been good.  They do serve coffee and tea.  There are a couple of tables inside, with usually the expected group of older Chinese guys chillin' in the corner table debating about something.  Great place to stock up on the buns, which I usually do before leaving town.   \n",

Learn from our mistake--order your own sandwich, and if you can't finish it, save half for later. We ended up going back for another sandwich (the one with chicken tenders, mac &amp; cheese, and bacon--I can't remember the name) anyway. We also got two orders of bread pudding to bring home, which, though pretty good cold, is ever better when you heat it up in the oven for 10-15 minutes.</td>\n",

I only wish I lived closer to Philly so that I could eat here more often. The prices are affordable, the portions are generous, the staff is friendly, and the food is AMAZING. \\n\\nThe last time I went to the Plum Pit, I ordered a jerk chicken sandwich to split with a friend. Learn from our mistake--order your own sandwich, and if you can't finish it, save half for later. We ended up going back for another sandwich (the one with chicken tenders, mac & cheese, and bacon--I can't remember the name) anyway. We also got two orders of bread pudding to bring home, which, though pretty good cold, is ever better when you heat it up in the oven for 10-15 minutes.  \n",

Stupidly delicious. \\n\\nShould be a 4.5 because they were a little slow compared to other trucks, but once the food showed up, totally ON POINT.\\n\\nWe had the bacon Mac and cheese with the French fry bowl, topped with jerk chicken. I could not get enough of the jerk chicken. And the bacon Mac and cheese was super creamy ( again 4.5 we saw a big can of nacho cheese instead of good cheese \" . \\n\\nWould definitely eat here again if they were at the Stables.  \n",

This food was really good! We all got one of almost everything and tasted it. We were so surprised.  The portion size was on point! Chef Floyd and T (Angie was her name on the contract) did a great job executing the orders in the heat. They made a great team. They worked very well together and had a great sense of humor. The next time I'm in the area, I will definitely look them up. If you are having an event and are in or around the Media, Pennsylvania area you should definitely look them up and have their food truck at your next event!  \n",

Get a table on the sidewalk and do some people watching (always fun) while you eat some wonderful food.\\n\\nI had the pot roast, it was awesome...homemade and full of richness!  The seafood looked outstanding too...although I don't know why the table next to me ordered 3 burgers and beers.  Uhhhh, perhaps not a burger joint, guys?  The burgers looked ok...but try something else!\\n\\nThe waitstaff is attentive, knowledgeable, and there just enough to take care of you while letting you relax and people watch on the sidewalk.\\n\\nFor a sidewalk cafe they have a nice menu, full bar, and great service.

The location is perfect because you can get trashed at some hellhole in Laclede's Landing and then walk one short block and begin gaming. It's also a short walk from most downtown hotels. My only problems with the place are: not enough craps tables for the Saturday night rush, and table games aren't well marked. I somehow started playing holdem thinking I was at a blackjack table. I'm not kidding, that actually happened.   \n",

In a shopping center where you'd expect to find nasty chain restaurants, like Chile's and Applebee's.... Don't let the line fool you, I hate lines and that was my first impression of this place is, great a huge line, but it moves fast. As bad as lines are they also mean the food is probably good. I ordered the carne aside sopes, the gf got the Chiles Nortenos with shrimp. I also ordered a side of guac. Both meals were great, I've had sopes in Mexico and the ones here were just as good. The Chiles Nortenos were amazing. Rice and beans were great and their salsa bar was awesome. Guac was decent too.  \n",

       "2783822  This is a famous sidewalk restaurant in the heart of Nola.  Get a table on the sidewalk and do some people watching (always fun) while you eat some wonderful food. I had the pot roast, it was awesome...homemade and full of richness!  The seafood looked outstanding too...although I don't know why the table next to me ordered 3 burgers and beers.  Uhhhh, perhaps not a burger joint, guys?  The burgers looked ok...but try something else! The waitstaff is attentive, knowledgeable, and there just enough to take care of you while letting you relax and people watch on the sidewalk. For a sidewalk cafe they have a nice menu, full bar, and great service.  A fun lunch spot to watch the world walk by while you relax in Nola.  \n",

Has anyone been to a nicer casino in the Midwest? There's a Four Seasons attached and non-buffet restaurants. Classy! The location is perfect because you can get trashed at some hellhole in Laclede's Landing and then walk one short block and begin gaming. It's also a short walk from most downtown hotels. My only problems with the place are: not enough craps tables for the Saturday night rush, and table games aren't well marked. I somehow started playing holdem thinking I was at a blackjack table. I'm not kidding, that actually happened.  \n",

Don't let the line fool you, I hate lines and that was my first impression of this place is, great a huge line, but it moves fast. As bad as lines are they also mean the food is probably good. I ordered the carne aside sopes, the gf got the Chiles Nortenos with shrimp. I also ordered a side of guac. Both meals were great, I've had sopes in Mexico and the ones here were just as good. The Chiles Nortenos were amazing. Rice and beans were great and their salsa bar was awesome. Guac was decent too.   \n",

       "14411   this grand center location by the fox theater has one of the best burgers in town: burger flame-broiled, between two thick slabs of texas toast, with all the trimmings. i think cheese is a few cents extra. it's a good price, but you might have to deal with a long line which i've seen go out the door.  here's a tip: if you want your food fast, go to the \"take out\" line. that way, you don't have to deal with the line, or the people shouting out your oder, but you do end up missing watching the comedy that exists between the workers behind the counter.  i've tried a chicken sandwich there, and felt i should have stuck to the burger... maybe next time, i'll try their gyro.   \n",

       "1  i've been having a terrible time in st louis finding a decent chinese place that is within delivery or easy take out range of our house. this time i tried wei hong. i told my partner it can't be any worse than the other mediocre places we have been going. i was wrong.the take out service was fast for a sat night. we were there within 20 minutes of ordering and it was ready. but the dining room was empty. for a sat night that should have been a big clue. the rest of the places in the neighborhood were busy.the steamed dumplings could have been great. the tasted homemade and the filling was good. however, they were so doughy with a really thick wrapper too thick that it detracted from the good filling. everything else went downhill from there. the beef and broccoli was inedible. the beef had an awful weird texture. like it was boiled and was gelatinous.  the sauce on it had off flavors. we literally scraped it off our plates and threw the whole thing out.  the meat in both the general tao's chicken and the orange beef also had weird textures. it was mushy and the coating was thick on those as well. the flavors in the sauces would have been fine, but they were gloopy.  the fried rice was fair but nothing memorable.we won't be going back.   \n",

       "23  i give this place 5 stars! 5 stars for being the worst place i have ever eaten in my life.overpricedunder portionedand sacrilegious  no attention to detail whatsoever.our fries were extremely soggy and under seasoned.my friend ordered the \"token side sauce\" which was nowhere to be found when our order came. it was later discovered actually slathered all over his burger instead of on the side when he took his first bites. out of pure curiosity, i decided to try something on the menu called \"furnace\".was this a dipping sauce, a side, an actual furnace? i had no idea.this actually ended up being a refreshing chili relish, which i will give 1 star out of 5, as opposed to my 5 star review for this being the worst place i have ever eaten. the burger i got was extremely small and if you had told me it was from frozen, i would easily believe it. after a little research i found out they are known for their \"fresh\" ingredients....the bun was very comparable to one from white castle or any other mediocre fast food chain.there was what i assume to be lettuce or spinach on my burger? i couldn't tell because it was so liquified by the time i took my first bites. to top it all off my mom ran out of ketchup so i had to ask her to get some at wal mart on her way home from work.she was not impressed with the fries either.   \n",

       "2  eh, i don't know how much i liked it here.  i read that it can get crowded.  no problem, i'll go in at 2:15pm, after the lunch rush is over.  that didn't work.  when i walked in, it looked like a mosh pit full of people.  there's really no clear direction on where to stand or if there are lines or what goes on here.  i had to ask the people standing around me to figure out what to do.  people were standing all over and right over the people sitting at the tables, which is annoying for those who are seated.  i guess it's pretty convenient to put in your order on a touch screen and pay right at the terminal with a credit card.  it makes it fast, but that is where fast stops.   i was with one of my coworkers who had a strict 30 minute lunch, timed by a time clock.  unfortunately she wasn't even able to order and get her food within this timeframe....at 2:15pm.  it's not like we walked in at 12:00 pm on the dot.  we both ordered stir fry and i ordered the honey bar.  cute idea, but if you get both, it's going to cost you.  almost $17.00 for \"work lunch\" seems like a lot to me.  after my coworker had to leave, i stayed and waited for our food, which finally came out.  it would also help if they displayed the numbers as they came up, so you'd have some type of idea of your place in line. the honey bar was good but not filling.  the stir fry was pretty tasty!  i liked the sesame seeds and fresh jalapenos. maybe if i call in my order ahead of time, i'll come back sometime.   \n",

       "      <td>i am so glad this was a surprise dinner by my so because i would have never tried this placed if i had known ahead of time where we were going because of the poor service reviews on yelp. as you can see we clearly had great service but we were in a rush to meet some people after dinner so we weren't one of their dreaded \"lingerers\".  the reviews such as victoria's, mei, and disappointed c. make me think this probably won't be a date night spot  or for group gatherings because most people like to talk and linger in those situations and they seem to want people in and out quickly.   probably a good place to grab dinner before meeting up with your group or before drinks later, not a place for groups to meet.    go to the silver peak across the street from this place for group events. out of the dozens of times i have to the silver peak, i've ordered food only once or twice and they never cared how long we lingered with our group or that most of us only ordered drinks. the silver peak lives tolerates group gatherings. this place doesn't seem as open to those events.  service - 5 stars. if it was possible  i would give our waitress 6 stars. food - 4.5 stars  ambiance - 5 stars</td>\n",

       "      <td>i don't really head to franklin often so i figured i would look around for an interesting place to dine. gray's quickly caught me eye with it's classic look and lively vibe. the food was delicious but definitely on the expensive side. i decided to only have an appetizer which instead of a meal because of this. the waitress was a complete joy to talk to and served my table very promptly. my only real problem with the place is that i just so happened to witness a waiter slapping a waitress' ass as he passed by. her reaction told me that she was not at all happy with that. we reported what we saw to another employee but we were concerned that this complaint may not be taken as seriously as it should. the waiter's nonchalant manner of slapping her leads me to believe that he has done this more than once. he was wearing a hat and glasses and believe his name to be trevor. so trevor, if you are in fact the one who slapped her, shame on you and hope you lose your job. i'm giving this restaurant a one star review solely because of the actions of this employee. i hope management will see this review and take action accordingly. edit:the manager has contacted us and informed us that the trevor has been fired. i'm impressed that management has taken our complaints seriously and corrected this problem.</td>\n",

       "25  i have never been so jealous in my entire life. my husband and i had a show to go to last weekend and wanted to grab drinks and dinner before hand so we stopped into the flowing tide since it was near our venue.  i have never been to this one before and i am green with envy. you see, we are sparks locals.  the tide in sparks is so not awesome.  that's a review already written and water under the bridge.   the whole concept of this tide is basically flip flopped from the other one.  the family dining section is smaller.  less of a sports bar and more of an actual restaurant.  the smoking side is huge!  it has tons of seating, a great horseshoe shaped bar and a separate adults only room with pool tables and video games!!!  the place was busy but everyone had a place to sit and talk, people were laughing playing and the ventilation system allowed the room to be comfortable and saturated in cigarette smoke.  the bartender heather was nice and attentive. this really is the more successful business model of the two i have visited.  i have no idea why the sparks location is so different - perhaps it is because sparks has plenty of smoking bars and lacks in family sports bar dining unless you take bully's into consideration.  i am hoping that they open another tide in the sparks area that offers this type of environment.  there is a great shopping center at vista and los altos with vacant space that would be perfect for them to expand to.  i heard on the whisper that dotty's is trying to get in that location right now - i hope that's not true, that's the last thing that area needs.  the tide would be awesome there. anyhow, rather than day dreaming about expanding the tide's business reach i'll sum up this review by saying if you live in northwest reno, this place is a home run.   \n",

       "4996  despite living in tucson my whole life, not to mention all the times we've driven up to summerhaven just to have a meal and enjoy cooler weather, i've never managed to make it up to the little restaurant located in ski valley.  however, on a warm winter day (yay tucson), we had it on good authority there was still some snow on the mountain. my husband and i decided to take the kiddo up for some play in snow (at least, the little that was left!) and lunch.  we started at ski valley (note: at the time you could not go onto the run to play in the snow. you could ride the lift up to the top then directly back down--no getting off and walking around. for this once up-and-down we found it to be way too pricey to give it a go... i think it was between $15-20 a person. no thanks! we found some snow in the parking lot, mission accomplished.) across the street is the iron door, and we wandered over to check it out. first thought was it was tiny, but cute (quaint). it looks like there's less than two dozen tables around, so definitely not the type of place you'd want to spring on with a large party. there was a cute (quaint) outdoor patio too that my husband and i agreed might make the restaurant good to rent out for a party or reception.  they had a decent kids menu, and a good sized regular one too. we decided on just sharing a bunch of appetizers. the spinach artichoke dip was great! i could have lived without the potato skins, they were just ok. we each had a piece of pie afterwards and they were both good-to-great. not as good a the cranky pie lady who used to be in summerhaven (god rest her soul), but a suitable replacement.  price was reasonable, service was attentive, and food was good. i reckon we'll definitely be back in those hot summer months!   \n",

       "      <td>despite living in tucson my whole life, not to mention all the times we've driven up to summerhaven just to have a meal and enjoy cooler weather, i've never managed to make it up to the little restaurant located in ski valley.  however, on a warm winter day (yay tucson), we had it on good authority there was still some snow on the mountain. my husband and i decided to take the kiddo up for some play in snow (at least, the little that was left!) and lunch.  we started at ski valley (note: at the time you could not go onto the run to play in the snow. you could ride the lift up to the top then directly back down--no getting off and walking around. for this once up-and-down we found it to be way too pricey to give it a go... i think it was between $15-20 a person. no thanks! we found some snow in the parking lot, mission accomplished.) across the street is the iron door, and we wandered over to check it out. first thought was it was tiny, but cute (quaint). it looks like there's less than two dozen tables around, so definitely not the type of place you'd want to spring on with a large party. there was a cute (quaint) outdoor patio too that my husband and i agreed might make the restaurant good to rent out for a party or reception.  they had a decent kids menu, and a good sized regular one too. we decided on just sharing a bunch of appetizers. the spinach artichoke dip was great! i could have lived without the potato skins, they were just ok. we each had a piece of pie afterwards and they were both good-to-great. not as good a the cranky pie lady who used to be in summerhaven (god rest her soul), but a suitable replacement.  price was reasonable, service was attentive, and food was good. i reckon we'll definitely be back in those hot summer months!</td>\n",

       "4996  despite living in tucson my whole life, not to mention all the times we've driven up to summerhaven just to have a meal and enjoy cooler weather, i've never managed to make it up to the little restaurant located in ski valley.  however, on a warm winter day (yay tucson), we had it on good authority there was still some snow on the mountain. my husband and i decided to take the kiddo up for some play in snow (at least, the little that was left!) and lunch.  we started at ski valley (note: at the time you could not go onto the run to play in the snow. you could ride the lift up to the top then directly back down--no getting off and walking around. for this once up-and-down we found it to be way too pricey to give it a go... i think it was between $15-20 a person. no thanks! we found some snow in the parking lot, mission accomplished.) across the street is the iron door, and we wandered over to check it out. first thought was it was tiny, but cute (quaint). it looks like there's less than two dozen tables around, so definitely not the type of place you'd want to spring on with a large party. there was a cute (quaint) outdoor patio too that my husband and i agreed might make the restaurant good to rent out for a party or reception.  they had a decent kids menu, and a good sized regular one too. we decided on just sharing a bunch of appetizers. the spinach artichoke dip was great! i could have lived without the potato skins, they were just ok. we each had a piece of pie afterwards and they were both good-to-great. not as good a the cranky pie lady who used to be in summerhaven (god rest her soul), but a suitable replacement.  price was reasonable, service was attentive, and food was good. i reckon we'll definitely be back in those hot summer months!   \n",

       "9  eh, i don't know how much i liked it here.  i read that it can get crowded.  no problem, i'll go in at 2:15pm, after the lunch rush is over.  that didn't work.  when i walked in, it looked like a mosh pit full of people.  there's really no clear direction on where to stand or if there are lines or what goes on here.  i had to ask the people standing around me to figure out what to do.  people were standing all over and right over the people sitting at the tables, which is annoying for those who are seated.  i guess it's pretty convenient to put in your order on a touch screen and pay right at the terminal with a credit card.  it makes it fast, but that is where fast stops.   i was with one of my coworkers who had a strict 30 minute lunch, timed by a time clock.  unfortunately she wasn't even able to order and get her food within this timeframe....at 2:15pm.  it's not like we walked in at 12:00 pm on the dot.  we both ordered stir fry and i ordered the honey bar.  cute idea, but if you get both, it's going to cost you.  almost $17.00 for \"work lunch\" seems like a lot to me.  after my coworker had to leave, i stayed and waited for our food, which finally came out.  it would also help if they displayed the numbers as they came up, so you'd have some type of idea of your place in line. the honey bar was good but not filling.  the stir fry was pretty tasty!  i liked the sesame seeds and fresh jalapenos. maybe if i call in my order ahead of time, i'll come back sometime.   \n",

       "4996  despite living in tucson my whole life, not to mention all the times we've driven up to summerhaven just to have a meal and enjoy cooler weather, i've never managed to make it up to the little restaurant located in ski valley.  however, on a warm winter day (yay tucson), we had it on good authority there was still some snow on the mountain. my husband and i decided to take the kiddo up for some play in snow (at least, the little that was left!) and lunch.  we started at ski valley (note: at the time you could not go onto the run to play in the snow. you could ride the lift up to the top then directly back down--no getting off and walking around. for this once up-and-down we found it to be way too pricey to give it a go... i think it was between $15-20 a person. no thanks! we found some snow in the parking lot, mission accomplished.) across the street is the iron door, and we wandered over to check it out. first thought was it was tiny, but cute (quaint). it looks like there's less than two dozen tables around, so definitely not the type of place you'd want to spring on with a large party. there was a cute (quaint) outdoor patio too that my husband and i agreed might make the restaurant good to rent out for a party or reception.  they had a decent kids menu, and a good sized regular one too. we decided on just sharing a bunch of appetizers. the spinach artichoke dip was great! i could have lived without the potato skins, they were just ok. we each had a piece of pie afterwards and they were both good-to-great. not as good a the cranky pie lady who used to be in summerhaven (god rest her soul), but a suitable replacement.  price was reasonable, service was attentive, and food was good. i reckon we'll definitely be back in those hot summer months!   \n",
