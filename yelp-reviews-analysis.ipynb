I think I went here almost every day one week to get the milk tea, only to realize that I should REALLY watch my sugar intake...it's sooo good!  \\n\\nI personally don't think it's better than Zhong Gang's HK-style milk tea because they have their off days when a certain lady makes them (not enough ice, too much ice, etc.).\\n\\nOn a side note:  I wanted to try the crispy roast pork bun, but accidentally said the wrong name in Chinese and got the roast pork bun.  It was decent enough, although I will get to trying the crispy roast pork bun soon!  \\n\\nI will be back~</td>\n",

The female cashier was very friendly (flirtatious!) and the pastries shown in nicely adorned display cases. I stopped by early one evening had a sesame ball, which was filled with bean paste. The glutinous rice of the ball was nicely flavored, similar to Bai Tang Gao. Definitely as place worth stopping at if you are in the area.   \n",

They have a decent variety of buns and pastries.  Red bean-filled buns, mung bean-filled buns, coconut stuff, egg tarts etc.  If you buy a dozen, they will give you two more for free.  The prices are standard for a Chinese bakery, with most things at approximately $1.  The service has always been good.  They do serve coffee and tea.  There are a couple of tables inside, with usually the expected group of older Chinese guys chillin' in the corner table debating about something.  Great place to stock up on the buns, which I usually do before leaving town.   \n",

The female cashier was very friendly (flirtatious!) and the pastries shown in nicely adorned display cases. I stopped by early one evening had a sesame ball, which was filled with bean paste. The glutinous rice of the ball was nicely flavored, similar to Bai Tang Gao. Definitely as place worth stopping at if you are in the area.  \n",

They have a decent variety of buns and pastries.  Red bean-filled buns, mung bean-filled buns, coconut stuff, egg tarts etc.  If you buy a dozen, they will give you two more for free.  The prices are standard for a Chinese bakery, with most things at approximately $1.  The service has always been good.  They do serve coffee and tea.  There are a couple of tables inside, with usually the expected group of older Chinese guys chillin' in the corner table debating about something.  Great place to stock up on the buns, which I usually do before leaving town.  \n",

       "4        HK-STYLE MILK TEA:  FOUR STARS\\n\\nNot quite sure why there are two Saint Honore Pastries business listings on Yelp, but I have been checking in to this one.\\n\\nBoyfriend and I go by it all the time while in Chinatown, but it never crossed our mind to try it.  I think we might have tried it once a year or two ago, but it wasn't memorable.  I decided to try the HK-style milk tea not too long ago and was hooked.  I think I went here almost every day one week to get the milk tea, only to realize that I should REALLY watch my sugar intake...it's sooo good!  \\n\\nI personally don't think it's better than Zhong Gang's HK-style milk tea because they have their off days when a certain lady makes them (not enough ice, too much ice, etc.).\\n\\nOn a side note:  I wanted to try the crispy roast pork bun, but accidentally said the wrong name in Chinese and got the roast pork bun.  It was decent enough, although I will get to trying the crispy roast pork bun soon!  \\n\\nI will be back~  \n",

The prices are affordable, the portions are generous, the staff is friendly, and the food is AMAZING. \\n\\nThe last time I went to the Plum Pit, I ordered a jerk chicken sandwich to split with a friend. Learn from our mistake--order your own sandwich, and if you can't finish it, save half for later. We ended up going back for another sandwich (the one with chicken tenders, mac & cheese, and bacon--I can't remember the name) anyway. We also got two orders of bread pudding to bring home, which, though pretty good cold, is ever better when you heat it up in the oven for 10-15 minutes.  \n",

This food was really good! We all got one of almost everything and tasted it. We were so surprised.  The portion size was on point! Chef Floyd and T (Angie was her name on the contract) did a great job executing the orders in the heat. They made a great team. They worked very well together and had a great sense of humor. The next time I'm in the area, I will definitely look them up. If you are having an event and are in or around the Media, Pennsylvania area you should definitely look them up and have their food truck at your next event!  \n",

Think cornbread with Chilies, onion and bacon. Delicious! My group of friends got an order of those and hashbrowns for the table to share. I got a t and j sandwich- essentially a grilled cheese with turkey. I tried a sandwich that came with a pretzel roll which was pretty good. \\n\\nThe special Santa fe pancakes were a standout, the sandwiches were average.   \n",

The manager (I think her name is Christine) took my order in drive thru. When I got to the window to pay, she said she didn't have my order and she can't take it from the window. She wanted me to get back in line. I asked for her manger's number and she took a torn receipt from the counter, gave it to me,  said bye black bitch and closed the window. I will never go to Burger King again. #Racist   \n",

It's clean, it's friendly, it's cute and cozy, and it's not pretentious.\\n\\nIt's mostly a neighborhood-y joint, which, to me, translates to awesome food. Unfortunately, its strong sense of community means it fills up fast for breakfast/brunch on the weekends. Luckily, we've found a way around this problem: since the Fitzwater Cafe is frequented by mostly working class locals, we've noticed that if you come for breakfast/lunch during the week (which they offer and I greatly appreciate), you will be seated immediately!\\n\\nOne of my favorites is the Prosciutto sandwich. It comes with the perfect ratio of pesto, greens, tomato, and meat on a satisfyingly crispy Sarcone's roll (which I am always a sucker for). I also add some fresh mozzarella to put it over the top. You get your choice of a side salad or homefries (both of which are worth trying). I always pretend that I'm only going to eat half of the sandwich and save the rest for later, but I always give in and devour the entire thing.   \n",

       "2404813  My family and I have eaten here for about 10 years for dim sum. I only get to frequent it when I come home for the holidays. But I hope we don't ever have to go back. The quality and variety of the dim sum used to be exquisite, and could be comparable to popular dim sum houses in Chicago and Seattle China towns. In the past 2-3 years, I've noticed the quality of the food has started slipping and this time it's at the point of no return. \\n\\nThe fong zao (sp?--chicken feet) were dry and bland, and worse of all, spoiled. We had to return the dish, and cross our fingers that we didn't get food poisoning. We also got the pepper steak dim sum. My dad described it best, \"one pile of s***.\" The layers of steak were stuck to each other, between layers of hardened cornstarched sauce. It lay on top of old disintegrated caramelized onions and green peppers. When you peeled the steak off, the middles of the meat were pink and cold...Eek! It makes me sad to see this quality of food. Redeeming dishes were the siu mai (pork and shrimp dumplings wrapped in a thin egg wrapper) and steamed shrimp dumplings (rice wrapper around shrimp). Both were hot, fresh, juicy, and flavorful. But they were missing some essentials: ha cheung fun (steamed wrapped shrimp noodles), ou yuen (beef meatballs), congee, etc... We also ordered a freshly cooked fish and vegetables, which was ...okay. \\n\\nI can forgive food flukes at a familiar family haunt, but bad service needs to be accounted for. After we returned the fong zao, we didn't have any carts frequent our table, and the cashier (the owner's cousin) was not very polite. \\n\\nI think my family continues to go here because they knew some of the friendly staff \"aunties\" (whose turn-over rate seems to have gone up) and because they offer unbeatable coupons. I will obviously do whatever my loyal parents want to do--because I'm a good Asian daughter :) --but I really really hope we never have to go there again! You get what you pay for!   \n",

No frills, low salt, great taste and fresh.  Killer salsa and the chicken burrito is my favorite.  I get the chicken burrito without rice and add guacamole, delicious.

Think cornbread with Chilies, onion and bacon. Delicious! My group of friends got an order of those and hashbrowns for the table to share. I got a t and j sandwich- essentially a grilled cheese with turkey. I tried a sandwich that came with a pretzel roll which was pretty good.  The special Santa fe pancakes were a standout, the sandwiches were average.  \n",

The manager (I think her name is Christine) took my order in drive thru. When I got to the window to pay, she said she didn't have my order and she can't take it from the window. She wanted me to get back in line. I asked for her manger's number and she took a torn receipt from the counter, gave it to me,  said bye black bitch and closed the window. I will never go to Burger King again. #Racist  \n",

It's clean, it's friendly, it's cute and cozy, and it's not pretentious. It's mostly a neighborhood-y joint, which, to me, translates to awesome food. Unfortunately, its strong sense of community means it fills up fast for breakfast/brunch on the weekends. Luckily, we've found a way around this problem: since the Fitzwater Cafe is frequented by mostly working class locals, we've noticed that if you come for breakfast/lunch during the week (which they offer and I greatly appreciate), you will be seated immediately! One of my favorites is the Prosciutto sandwich. It comes with the perfect ratio of pesto, greens, tomato, and meat on a satisfyingly crispy Sarcone's roll (which I am always a sucker for). I also add some fresh mozzarella to put it over the top. You get your choice of a side salad or homefries (both of which are worth trying). I always pretend that I'm only going to eat half of the sandwich and save the rest for later, but I always give in and devour the entire thing.  \n",

       "2404813  My family and I have eaten here for about 10 years for dim sum. I only get to frequent it when I come home for the holidays. But I hope we don't ever have to go back. The quality and variety of the dim sum used to be exquisite, and could be comparable to popular dim sum houses in Chicago and Seattle China towns. In the past 2-3 years, I've noticed the quality of the food has started slipping and this time it's at the point of no return.  The fong zao (sp?--chicken feet) were dry and bland, and worse of all, spoiled. We had to return the dish, and cross our fingers that we didn't get food poisoning. We also got the pepper steak dim sum. My dad described it best, \"one pile of s***.\" The layers of steak were stuck to each other, between layers of hardened cornstarched sauce. It lay on top of old disintegrated caramelized onions and green peppers. When you peeled the steak off, the middles of the meat were pink and cold...Eek! It makes me sad to see this quality of food. Redeeming dishes were the siu mai (pork and shrimp dumplings wrapped in a thin egg wrapper) and steamed shrimp dumplings (rice wrapper around shrimp). Both were hot, fresh, juicy, and flavorful. But they were missing some essentials: ha cheung fun (steamed wrapped shrimp noodles), ou yuen (beef meatballs), congee, etc... We also ordered a freshly cooked fish and vegetables, which was ...okay.  I can forgive food flukes at a familiar family haunt, but bad service needs to be accounted for. After we returned the fong zao, we didn't have any carts frequent our table, and the cashier (the owner's cousin) was not very polite.  I think my family continues to go here because they knew some of the friendly staff \"aunties\" (whose turn-over rate seems to have gone up) and because they offer unbeatable coupons. I will obviously do whatever my loyal parents want to do--because I'm a good Asian daughter :) --but I really really hope we never have to go there again! You get what you pay for!  \n",

       "4997  i like this place but this is why i gave it 2 stars. i went to this place almost 2 weeks ago with a friend. the atmosphere was great, they had a live band. we proceeded to go straight upstairs and to the bar that's in the far back. the bartender charged us $42 for two fish bowl drinks. i really thought that was extremely high since the place was not packed at all and it was latin night. i was scared to get a different drink because of the price. after we finished we went downstairs to the bar and ordered appetizer. the bartender ask me if i wanted a drink, i ordered a beer and made small talk about the price we paid upstairs. she told me the drinks we order should have been $18 a piece and not what we actually paid for. i was upset because i felt like the bartender upstairs over priced the drinks and stealing from me.  if anyone goes here and the drink price is ridiculous, second guess it before paying for it.   \n",

       "4997  i like this place but this is why i gave it 2 stars. i went to this place almost 2 weeks ago with a friend. the atmosphere was great, they had a live band. we proceeded to go straight upstairs and to the bar that's in the far back. the bartender charged us $42 for two fish bowl drinks. i really thought that was extremely high since the place was not packed at all and it was latin night. i was scared to get a different drink because of the price. after we finished we went downstairs to the bar and ordered appetizer. the bartender ask me if i wanted a drink, i ordered a beer and made small talk about the price we paid upstairs. she told me the drinks we order should have been $18 a piece and not what we actually paid for. i was upset because i felt like the bartender upstairs over priced the drinks and stealing from me.  if anyone goes here and the drink price is ridiculous, second guess it before paying for it.   \n",

Review sentiment composition gets murky with neutral sentiment since a neutral stance with a restaurant can have a bunch of negative or neutral comments. Would need to look at star rating to get a better view of what sentiment is majority in neutral classified reviews. Let's take a quick peek."

       "      <td>this review is overdue. i can't believe i haven't reviewed this place yet since my hubby and i have been coming here every time we are in santa barbara. we ate here again tonight and it doesn't disappoint. we had our favorite clam chowder. tried the santa barbara shrimp cocktail and it was very good and fresh.  we also had the oyster rockefeller and it was the bomb ! there is usually a waiting but they have a clipboard outside for you to list your name and they will call you once your seat is ready.  service is always on point. will come back again and again..</td>\n",

       "2  this has been one of our favorite restaurants for years. we have always sat in the bar area and enjoyed food and staff. we stopped by to try a meal after this horrible pandemic. the first disappointment was to see the entire bar area and outside seating is not available. the second disappointment was at the hostess stand. after standing there and being ignored for several minutes i believe it was a busser who came up to help. being as we did not have reservations, he shook his head and tried to survey the restaurant. when asked what he was doing he replied trying to space tables and account for being short staffed, and then announced a 45 minute wait. no thanks. we all know how hard it is to run a restaurant in normal times and now it's harder. this ship needs a captain to run it efficiently or it will sink. why would you not have the bar and the outside tables open? obviously you needed space and to run efficiently.  why book all available tables, you need to satisfy all customers. we have always just walked in, unless we book for a birthday party. the pandemic can't be blamed for poor planning. get management on the floor running things.   \n",

       "0  this has been one of our favorite restaurants for years. we have always sat in the bar area and enjoyed food and staff. we stopped by to try a meal after this horrible pandemic. the first disappointment was to see the entire bar area and outside seating is not available. the second disappointment was at the hostess stand. after standing there and being ignored for several minutes i believe it was a busser who came up to help. being as we did not have reservations, he shook his head and tried to survey the restaurant. when asked what he was doing he replied trying to space tables and account for being short staffed, and then announced a 45 minute wait. no thanks. we all know how hard it is to run a restaurant in normal times and now it's harder. this ship needs a captain to run it efficiently or it will sink. why would you not have the bar and the outside tables open? obviously you needed space and to run efficiently.  why book all available tables, you need to satisfy all customers. we have always just walked in, unless we book for a birthday party. the pandemic can't be blamed for poor planning. get management on the floor running things.   \n",

       "4   poor service but it depends entirely on which waiter.  we've gone there often and the food is better than average (with one exception see below) and had good service, but this trip, it was almost 10 minutes to even get a waiter to come by and give chips and salsa and get drink order (i was 1 minute from just getting up and leaving).  the food came for the 3 of us, but not a plate in sight to eat off of when we clearly stated in the beginning that we were sharing the 3 dishes.  watching him with other tables, he was clearly only paying attention as it came time to leave a tip, but not at other times during the meal.  that being said, we have been happy with other wait staff on other visits. the shrimp nachos were a huge disappointment, the limp nachos and less than generous amount of shrimp were buried under a large amount of lettuce.  i've never seen lettuce on nachos. we'll be back, but we will watch which waiter serves us.   \n",

       "4   poor service but it depends entirely on which waiter.  we've gone there often and the food is better than average (with one exception see below) and had good service, but this trip, it was almost 10 minutes to even get a waiter to come by and give chips and salsa and get drink order (i was 1 minute from just getting up and leaving).  the food came for the 3 of us, but not a plate in sight to eat off of when we clearly stated in the beginning that we were sharing the 3 dishes.  watching him with other tables, he was clearly only paying attention as it came time to leave a tip, but not at other times during the meal.  that being said, we have been happy with other wait staff on other visits. the shrimp nachos were a huge disappointment, the limp nachos and less than generous amount of shrimp were buried under a large amount of lettuce.  i've never seen lettuce on nachos. we'll be back, but we will watch which waiter serves us.   \n",

       "4   poor service but it depends entirely on which waiter.  we've gone there often and the food is better than average (with one exception see below) and had good service, but this trip, it was almost 10 minutes to even get a waiter to come by and give chips and salsa and get drink order (i was 1 minute from just getting up and leaving).  the food came for the 3 of us, but not a plate in sight to eat off of when we clearly stated in the beginning that we were sharing the 3 dishes.  watching him with other tables, he was clearly only paying attention as it came time to leave a tip, but not at other times during the meal.  that being said, we have been happy with other wait staff on other visits. the shrimp nachos were a huge disappointment, the limp nachos and less than generous amount of shrimp were buried under a large amount of lettuce.  i've never seen lettuce on nachos. we'll be back, but we will watch which waiter serves us.   \n",

       "1  [ok I am being really picky and took off a star because i would not eat inside the restaurant it is basically a trailer but it is a great divey mexican joint like joel m said it is right by colbys cocktails bonus that colbys lets you eat in their bar so you cannot miss it right off the clearview  110 service road behind the super 8 plus it is open 24 hours on friday and saturday nights when you have those late night cravings unless you know spanish you will have to point to what you want which is easy because the menu has pictures i ordered a shredded beef and a pork taco on a soft flour tortilla with cheese guacamole and sour cream inside man it was good plus the green sauce has some kick so i gently dipped a little with each bite i definitely want to try all their tacos now plus while we were waiting there some bowls of food that looked delicious and were being served to the patrons inside the restaurant  my friends ordered the torta huge football size sandwich tacos and chips and guacamole which everyone enjoyed their respective dishes keep in mind i take it as a good sign when i see hispanic people eating at a mexican joint plus if the people that work there are hispanic and speak spanisheven better one thing i found interesting was they had pupusas which is normally an el salvadorean dish  happy mexican eatingmuy delicioso, came here recently for dinner with my husband this mexican restaurant this place is a step up from a fast casual mexican place like chipotle or qdoba but not as nice as a higher end place like el vez it is waiter service but very casual they do not offer complimentary chips and salsa but we decided to get a order the chips and salsa were both really good the salsa is chunkier for dinner i had the chicken quesadilla which was great although not very big it had great flavor unlike some places where you get a chicken quesadilla and it tastes like you could have just made it at home with no seasoning my husband was happy with his meal as well service was good i saw they offer complimentary margaritas but I am not sure if this an actual margarita or just the mixer and you byo the tequila prices were reasonable as well i would definitely go back, we came in for a weekday lunch craving something cold and blended and also something hot and saucy for the former we tried a guava margarita that was advertised on their specials board sooo good it was creamier than most blended margs I have had and the guava flavor was perfect not too overwhelming it did not taste alcoholic in the least but that is not always a bad thing the food menu is extensive since i did not see any options for a combination plate i went with the sopes my better half opted for the enchiladas with al pastor and green sauce we barely had time to sip our margaritas and nibble on the fresh warm chips and spicy salsa before the food arrived it was so quick everything was steaming hot but we dove right in the sope base was crispy on the outside and soft and dense on the inside with plenty of masa flavor permeating through the toppings  carnitas lettuce tomato crema and cotija  worked in beautiful harmony and made me a very happy panda my boyfriends enchiladas were good but the real shining star of the whole thing was that green enchilada sauce holy tomatillo was it good tangy deep delicious sauce that i could drink by the cup full i highly recommend getting that green sauce on everything the only reason for the missing star is that the rice was basic lacking some flavor and the beans were nothing special i love traditional mexican food but i appreciate when all those good latin spices and flavors are infused in all aspects of the dish overall i really dig this place the service is great the atmosphere is nice and cozy especially for a strip mall restaurant and the food is good and plentiful what is spanish for yum]  \n",

       "1  poor service but it depends entirely on which waiter.  we've gone there often and the food is better than average (with one exception see below) and had good service, but this trip, it was almost 10 minutes to even get a waiter to come by and give chips and salsa and get drink order (i was 1 minute from just getting up and leaving).  the food came for the 3 of us, but not a plate in sight to eat off of when we clearly stated in the beginning that we were sharing the 3 dishes.  watching him with other tables, he was clearly only paying attention as it came time to leave a tip, but not at other times during the meal.  that being said, we have been happy with other wait staff on other visits. the shrimp nachos were a huge disappointment, the limp nachos and less than generous amount of shrimp were buried under a large amount of lettuce.  i've never seen lettuce on nachos. we'll be back, but we will watch which waiter serves us.   \n",
