Samsung and Google do not have AI in them just because you can run your finger around an item to Google it does not mean it’s AI. All it is is an updated Google lens. Google lens has been on phones for how long now?  ChatGPT is AI and Siri is now more like ChatGPT in iOS 18. This is how you know that people at Apple are smarter than other phone brands because they don’t label new features as AI just because everyone else is., Summarized by AskTube\\n\\nWWDC Keynote Highlights 📱\\n00:02 Apple's WWDC keynote was filled with exciting announcements, including a surprise introduction to AI in the second half.\\n\\n00:25 The author live-tweeted the event and summarizes all the key announcements and thoughts.\\n\\nVision OS 2.0 📊\\n00:47 Vision OS 2.0 brings new features like wrist-turn gestures to see time and battery percentage, and quick access to the control center.\\n\\n01:05 New Immersive Media Features: Turn old photos into spatial photos using advanced machine learning, and create spatial videos on non-iPhone cameras.\\n\\niOS Updates 📱\\n02:29 iOS got a major update with customizable home screens, icon placement, and a new theme engine.\\n\\n02:54 Customize your home screen with different colors, and change icon and widget colors to match your wallpaper.\\n\\nOther Updates 📊\\n03:37 Mac mirroring gets a higher resolution, and new tools are available for creating spatial and immersive videos.\\n\\n04:00 New features include scheduling text messages, text formatting, a game mode that minimizes background activity, and automatic categorization in the new mail app.\\n\\nAirPods and Apple TV Updates 🎧\\n06:05 AirPods got minor updates, including voice isolation during phone calls, spatial audio during games, and nodding or shaking for responding to prompts.\\n\\n06:25 Apple TV updates include showing actors' and characters' names on screen and boosting people's voices over the music.\\n\\niPad OS Updates 📊\\n06:41 iPad OS allows remote control of someone's iPad with their permission, perfect for family tech support.\\n\\n07:03 The calculator app on iPad OS is impressive, letting you write equations in handwriting and getting real-time answers.\\n\\nMac OS Updates 📊\\n09:40 Mac OS got a new version called Sequoia, featuring automatic window snapping, built-in backgrounds for webcam feeds, and a new password app.\\n\\nApple Intelligence AI 🤖\\n10:40 Apple rebranded AI as Apple Intelligence, bringing new generative models and large language models to supported devices.\\n\\n11:01 Apple Intelligence features include writing tools, a cleanup tool in Photos, and generative emojis.\\n\\nHow Apple Handles Complex AI Tasks 💻\\n15:10 Apple handles most AI tasks on-device, using Apple-built models for faster processing.

upgrades, since Jobs passed away in 2011.  It's expected, and has now become ad nauseam.  The elephant in the room is that they cannot innovate any more.  That era has gone.  There is too much under Cook that points to profits, not taking risks, and not pursuing innovation at all costs.  Very, very sad.  Their marketing and advertising has taken over, trying to convince you that their products are somewhat advanced.  They're not.  Psychology plays as a primary role in their efforts and effects.  Until we ALL push back and get  to innovate like they used to 20 years ago, expect more incremental upgrades without delivery.  AI development with ChatGPT? What a colossal joke.  You should already be 10+ years ahead in AI development, Apple.  You had your chance.  You ALL need to channel Steve Jobs in your daily efforts.  WWSJD?, My latest computer cost $40.  I bought an SSD for $20 and loaded it with Linux.  I suppose some people really need the \"latest and greatest\".  But I don't.  In about 16 months the \"used computer\" market will be FLOODED because Windows 10 will no longer be supported and Windows 11 needs new hardware.

support more broadly.\\n\\nTo me, iOS’s icon tinting doesn’t look as good as Android’s Material You icon theming. iOS looks like it just applies a color overlay, so the icons with gradients look dated to me. On Android, each app developer has to submit a separate icon for theming, so Android’s flatter monotone icons look better to me. \\n\\nThe upside of the iOS implementation is that it seems to tint all icons right off the bat, whereas on Android, each developer has to intentionally enable it. On Android, you end up with a few rogue unthemed icons. Neither implementation is perfect., I really want to know if i can keep the \"normal\" color icons when in dark mode. I hate how the black icons look, It's about time Apple with being able to move icons.]  \n7

                         [My takeaway was that across MacOS, iOS and iPadOS I found very few things that I could tell I would include in my daily use.\\n\\nI already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions. \\n\\nI could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter!\\n\\nI just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro. \\n\\nThis came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\"\\n\\nI already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup. \\n\\nApple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels.\\n\\nSoftwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works.\\n\\nSo, I'm out, except for Mac., i do think many of the new customization features in iOS 18 are some of the most memorable yet in recent years of iOS updates. Unironically finally having a calculator app for the iPad is great lol. Then Apple's AI looks really cool. I'm interested to see more development of it and some demos later this year.\\n\\nThe big downside for me is like many have said, but despite having a super powerful new M4 iPad Pro from a hardware perspective, the OS for it still lacks to use its full potential. I personally don't need it to be touch screen Mac like many others would like it to be. The iPad is clearly not suppose to be that. But at the very least, it would be nice to have a better file management system, an eject feature for external devices plugged into the iPad to make sure it's unplugged safely, custom made apps specifically for iPadOS for all major social medias, stores, restaurants, etc (looking at you Instagram and numerous store/restaurant apps). There was nothing shown both here and the iPad drops last month that my current M2 iPad Pro can't do so I feel there's no reason to upgrade and probably won't need to for many years., Just give us Mac

good. \\n\\nI have no way to prove this of course, but I bet you've seen good AI images and simply had no idea that's what you were looking at. These services can absolutely generate images indistinguishable from real life. In this case (and others) the images are stylized for branding purposes and also it takes a lot less computing power., i hate the image generation stuff so much, directly takes work away from real artists and encourages people to generate some horrifying looking images]  \n29                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           [I think apple gets that AI is the combustion engine of this era.  As we develop more sophisticated processing powers, it will allow us to make better and better systems.  We have the sizes of the devices optimized but soon we will see it able to do more.  That is why it is not artificial intelligence because it is about integrating into the filter of apple's devices and capabilities.  Rabbit is poorly designed and cannot improve itself because it lacks the ability to provide feedback to the AI.  When they design the products and services including apple, there has to be at least 2 options to where it can tailor solutions to it unless there is a certain solution like in maths as the best feedback is that it is wrong.  If there is an idiocracy movie, it is that we all become so reliant on AI that no one checks the answer to a math problem and everyone just takes AI's word for it and the math problem is completely wrong.  That is a problem., i am not looking forward to this massive push of AI. I do not want AI controlling my life. Apple already knows way to much stuff about me now they want to add features that would gain complete access to my phone and all my information. Imagine the cyber attack that could be pulled off if intergrade AI into everything we do. I am not against newer tech, Just wish it wasn't be mass pushed to onto the public like this. Apple says its safe with lots of security features but anyone ever think they just say this shit to sell the product.  The kids growing up on this stuff will be dumbest era of humans ever. AI has grown so fast in the last 2 years that it will replace humans. Please tell me what is the goal for AI other then to replace human and human errors. They fact that the world I'm becoming a man in is slowly turning into the Wall-e movie. Best of luck younger generations to come because I cant see a world where you will be able to survive., 10:41~11:03 \"They'd say anything else -- Neural Nets, Machine Learning .. But people want to hear Apple talk about AI.\" \\nJesus F*cking Christ Almighty , As someone with an AI degree this is the kind of thing that puts a shotgun shell in my hope for humanity. This is literally the equivalent of an Auto Manufacturer talking about Engines, Wheels, Body Paint, Dashes, Leather Seats, and Safety Features, and the public going \"We don't want to hear about that boring stuff, get with the times we want to you to talk about CARS!\" Like my Brother In Christ WHAT DO YOU THINK A CAR F*CKING IS ??????????? \\n\\nWith that rant out of the way, I trust Apple, and I trust Meta with AI. I ABSOLUTELY do Not trust Google Or Microsoft (ChatGPT) with AI -- They've both already rushed to release literal garbage that's genuinely hilarious in how bad it is. ChatGPT peaked a while ago and is getting worse with time, and OpenAI is an Extremely Shady company. Apple does a WAY better job at this kind of thing, as does Meta in a different way. I can see myself disabling ChatGPT as a possible option if given the chance, and exclusively using Apple's homegrown systems. Meta's Llama is what happens when you let the people who ACTUALLY understand AI , and competent developers in a large competent corporate structure, design and create the thing instead of the Executives who's understanding of AI is about as deep as you can dig into concrete.]  \n30

does already, it’s a step towards no apps, just AI, which would imply total customization., After 14 iOS updates, we finally get customization …, Fun fact: many people have been complaining about IOS customization but guess what! This customization has been on android like forever and the more you customize your phone the more it looks awful and at the end of the day you came back to the normal screen. The point is people like wasting their time. This customization thing is like playing games where you fail and come back to the start 😅]  \n41

We need keywords back for iOS.  IS there anything in WWDC24 to help us organize our photos with keywords, metadata and use it to select and organize our photos.  Memories is great. We need to access our photos ourselves as well..\\n\\nWe need less icon programming and more Photos functionality to organize our photos our way.  \\n\\nIf anyone knows of any apps that do this please add a reply. Thanks., Photo app still needs so much work. Would be nice to have more filter options for instance filter images that were “saved” or downloaded from the web or even a specific filter for photos saved from google drive or Dropbox etc.\\n\\nOne of the HUGE ideas I came up with is in the main “recents” album (what I use most when I’m browsing my photos) is a way to bulk up photos within that view into one square/icon IE if you take consecutive videos or photos at a concert, you could select the string of photos to compile into a single “folder” of sorts WITHIN the gallery view that way there isn’t 10-20+ photos taking up large chunks of the photo grid. Another example is when I take product photos of items to sell on eBay/marketplace, there’s 50+ photos back to back that take up my gallery that bury all my other day to day photos and videos. Putting them in an album is great to just access those product photos but when I’m browsing for general photos/videos, it’s very stressful seeing them take up so much space.\\n\\nHopefully you can visualize what I’m saying. \\n\\nCheers, please still my idea Apple 👍]  \n54

features and nothing special kind of event for me., I had a smile for a moment from some of the features they presented today. Felt like the first Moon landing of the tech space today, huge productivity changes!!, Something I have noticed with the YouTube guys…the need to try to determine who had a feature first and then be quietly snobby about it. One, they always get it wrong. They never go far enough back to give true recognition for the feature. Two, nobody cares but fanboys. In other words it is never a good look. That’s all. I just seem to be seeing it more than usual lately.]  \n59

there is no conversational mode to Siri. It has context but it seemed as if you need to trigger Siri for every question. Not the best way to interact as ChatGPT has this feature. Also the prompt about whether something needs to be sent to ChatGPT is silly. Why not simply allow people to choose which AI model they want to use and save in settings rather than ask everytime. The overall experience feels annoying. They may improve this along the way may be by iOS 25 but could have been a lot better if they just learn how people interact with Siri. People are not looking at the phone they are merely talking to it., Apple intelligence:\\nAsk Siri --> Siri asks ChatGPT., Siri GPT]  \n67

phrase in the keynote and these types of videos is wild to me. This is maybe the biggest piece of news. For those who aren't familiar, Rich Communication Services (RCS) is what google messages has been using on Android phones for a few years now to show you when someone is typing, offer read receipts, which show when someone has read or received your message, read receipts also show your contact when you read their message, send messages over mobile data and Wi-Fi, and let you share files and high-resolution photos. RCS is what makes texting as good as instant messaging and the whole system has honestly kind of sucked because Apple would NOT enable these features on their devices. I know people love to clown on the old green-bubble blue-bubble stuff in the past but as an Android user, I am so happy for the iPhone users who are now getting access to this. It is an absolute game-changer of an upgrade and I honestly think apple not updating to RCS until today really hurt text-messaging as a business item because texting apps came and filled the hollow void with cool features that the default text app (on iPhone) just wouldn't do., if they finally have RCS support that's great for android users]  \n72

updates in the Calendar app as well as its integration with Apple Reminders. \\n\\nI can finally ditch Fantastical!, Nobody is talking about the reminders/calendar app, >I can finally ditch Fantastical!\\n\\nUnless you use any of the advanced features, then you maybe still can’t.  \\n\\nI see an all day task in the screen shots for iOS 18. Fantastical gives you the option to not show those and only show tasks with a time. You can also choose which Reminders lists show in the Calendar. Hopefully Apple offers that. You have calendar sets where you can pick & choose which calendars and reminders lists are shown together in different situations. \\n\\nAnother benefit for me is that Fantastical is always in the Share Sheet so I can create a calendar event or reminder from anywhere in iOS. It is context dependent whether Calendar or Reminders is in the share sheet, so I find myself using the Fantastical option quite often.\\n\\nThen of course there is the natural language entry for both calendar events and reminders in Fantastical. \\n\\nI will be definitely be curious to see how Apple’s changes compare to what is available in Fantastical.]  \n75

Apple AI free! Even though you have to buy the latest device, these free upgrade will bring big changes and possibly make generative AI free universally! (Think grammarly, and how on Samsung you have to pay for the extra features), It is crazy how many features Android and Samsung have already had, but at the same time, many phones adopted the notch and didn't have to, so Apple gets one free ride this time.  I'm more interested in the fact that Samsung chose Google Gemini to back their AI efforts, and apple chose GPT the same as Microsoft even though it seems co-pilot is becoming its own thing now it's still GPT tech, That's just a dunk on Samsung, not being able to do galaxy AI on device, and later on having to pay for Galaxy AI.\\n\\nWhile apple doing all this AI for free]  \n83

YouTubers reason to point out EVERY SINGLE TIME Apple copies an Android feature! It’s not like Android hasn’t copied Apple a thousand times but they are rarely if ever part of a YouTube video., You have less subscribers than YouTube? Which of you out there are subbed to Apple? Like really what is the point of that? It is a useless subscription. Anything posted there will be later than any news outlet can get the word to everyone. IF you get your Apple news from Apple YouTube, then you are doing it wrong., **TIL**: You can't scrub back to the beginning of Apple's video stream on [**Apple.com**](http://Apple.com), the **Developer** app, or even **YouTube**. I was running late and thought I could scrub back to the beginning on YouTube (as I do with other live streams), but no luck.

What the hell is this 2008? LMFAO, I have been putting my apps anywhere I want to on my Home Screen for the last 4 years…..

Yes, I use folders.

these iphone features now is that they don't have to gatekeep it anymore since the AI thing is what they think they can put their hands on. \\nI believe even apple can't handle gatekeeping too many things at once, so after the new hotness came, they threw away the old one  in a way., Hey mkbhd, I really hope you test iphone AI with airplane mode on (or something more, like physical blocking the wifi signal) simply to fully test whether it does all of this stuff offline. I think there's an inherent distrust in the avg consumers view of ai, Yes it is a big feature. And it's unlucky that it supports the last four generations of M chips, but only one generation of iPhone chip. Well it will actually be two by the time it's ready.\\n\\nBut we were happily living without it until now. Newer iPhones having it doesn't suddenly make your iPhone any worse than it currently is.\\n\\nAnd I think some people might overrate how often would they actually use it. Let's use our brains while we still can. We will be looking back at these \"good old times\" one day thinking how good it was when everything wasn't done by AI yet. It will just be boring when every message, email etc. will be generated with one click.]  \n96

AI feature? I’m happy you asked! ;) Scheduling texts. Long overdue IMO. Biggest AI feature? AI calculator in text. That’s cool and useful., Biggest non-AI feature is scheduling text messages, My favorite non-artificial intelligence feature is the send later texting feature. I bought an Android as a second phone to experience the other side, and out of all the features on Android, that was the one that stood out to me. Because there are times when I want to send a message late at night, and it’s not appropriate to send it to a colleague at that time. So, scheduling for the future when I have time makes sense so that it reaches the recipient at a time appropriate for them. I also liked the satellite texting feature because I recently started researching alternatives to LTE and discovered satellites. So, when you’re on a ship in the middle of the ocean, a satellite would be the ideal way to send text messages because there are no cell towers around you.]  \n103

I know they are saying all m chip Mac’s will get apple intelligence but do you think the older models (m3-m1) will be limited in someway., truly gutted, last years WWDC saw the Mac Studio get a chip upgrade, and earlier this year i ultimately got to a point where i could no longer work because simply viewing a photo caused my MacBook's (2018 pro) fans to spin up - and it runs hot !\\n\\nbut, i've waited it out for months in hopes of the upgrade to come, and my patience did not pay off\\n\\nto go from a 2018 intel MacBook Pro to an M2 Max Mac Studio is gonna be a hell of an upgrade\\n - but imagine leapfrogging the first two, maybe even three generation M chips to land on an M3/M4 Max\\n\\nyet somehow, whilst iPad 'what is a computer' nerds can pick up an M4 chip for no more than a thousand dollars; these pro machines are undeniably left behind on M2 for the time being 🙄 makes total sense.]  \n104

It’s Shot on iPhone. Unless you can prove that other recording devices were used, the statement is completely and totally true and accurate. Nowhere did Apple claim they didn’t use dolleys and cranes, storage capture devices, etc. In fact they ADVERTISED that they used that stuff. \\n\\nYour opinion is your opinion and that’s valid, but the world has moved on from the faux outrage select “publications” manufactured about this. It was and is Shot on iPhone. And yes, you can get stunning video with zero equipment. But as I said in my reply:\\n\\n>You can still produce excellent video without thousands of dollars worth of equipment. But if your argument here is trying to say that Apple wouldn't have taken advantage of the iPhone and all the clout that Shot on iPhone would bring if Equipment was the only thing barring it from producing Hollywood quality video…..\\n\\nEquipment is a third of the equation in a professional production, the other third being the recording device, and the last third being the professionals working on it, directing it, editing it, etc., The known iPhone rigs Apple actually used in the past are mostly rigs that allow for attaching data storage and power. External recording only enables 4K 60fps, which is probably not needed nor desired for most shots (where you want to use more normal frame rates). So it doesn’t change a thing concerning image quality, just adds convenience. (No power loss. Easily work with the captured data.)\\n\\nAlso, the rigs allow Apple to attach the phones to stuff that moves the camera around, allowing for good camera movement. This, however, does not correct for a deficiency of the iPhone camera. Any camera, no matter how expensive, can’t magically move on its own and create those camera moves. It will be attached to the very same equipment to move it around.\\n\\nThat equipment makes for great camera moves and that does improve the footage, sure, but that’s down to the movement equipment, not the camera, no matter the camera.\\n\\nObviously Apple uses artificial lighting equipment. As they should. Because light is obviously decisive when it comes to filming and will massively improve images. But Apple would use lighting no matter the camera. So all the same things apply to lighting that also apply to camera movement. Improves the footage, sure, but that’s down to the lighting equipment, not the camera, no matter the camera.\\n\\nI haven’t seen Apple attach lenses to the iPhone. Probably because it’s a bad idea and will degrade image quality. Attaching different lenses would really only make sense if you could remove the original lenses. Which you can’t. So Apple doesn’t do it.\\n\\nShooting on an iPhone severely limits art direction. It limits how you can work with depth field. It probably limits your dynamic range, meaning certain shots are just not possible. It limits the focal lengths you can use. These are all severe limitations that no attached equipment can solve.\\n\\nThis isn’t so simple. You cannot magically attach equipment to a camera to get any result you want., I’m curious why that matters. Is RED or an Alexa somehow compromised because of all of the lenses, dolleys, and equipment attached to it? I have zero clue why the equipment attached to it matters. Apple couldn’t film it with previous iPhones even though they were generally great for video. Now Apple can with all the improvements made to the camera, including Log recording. The fact that no one even knew it was shot on iPhone until they stated it at the Mac event goes to show how far video on iPhone has come. You can still produce excellent video without thousands of dollars worth of equipment. But if your argument here is trying to say that Apple wouldn't have taken advantage of the iPhone and all the clout that Shot on iPhone would bring if Equipment was the only thing barring it from

There is too much under Cook that points to profits, not taking risks, and not pursuing innovation at all costs.  Very, very sad.  Their marketing and advertising has taken over, trying to convince you that their products are somewhat advanced.  They're not.  Psychology plays as a primary role in their efforts and effects.  Until we ALL push back and get  to innovate like they used to 20 years ago, expect more incremental upgrades without delivery.  AI development with ChatGPT? What a colossal joke.

On Android, each app developer has to submit a separate icon for theming, so Android’s flatter monotone icons look better to me. \\n\\nThe upside of the iOS implementation is that it seems to tint all icons right off the bat, whereas on Android, each developer has to intentionally enable it. On Android, you end up with a few rogue unthemed icons. Neither implementation is perfect., I really want to know if i can keep the \"normal\" color icons when in dark mode.

I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions. \\n\\nI could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter!\\n\\nI just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro. \\n\\nThis came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\"\\n\\nI already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup. \\n\\nApple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels.\\n\\nSoftwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works.\\n\\nSo, I'm out, except for Mac., i do think many of the new customization features in iOS 18 are some of the most memorable yet in recent years of iOS updates. Unironically finally having a calculator app for the iPad is great lol. Then Apple's AI looks really cool. I'm interested to see more development of it and some demos later this year.\\n\\nThe big downside for me is like many have said, but despite having a super powerful new M4 iPad Pro from a hardware perspective, the OS for it still lacks to use its full potential. I personally don't need it to be touch screen Mac like many others would like it to be. The iPad is clearly not suppose to be that.

That is why it is not artificial intelligence because it is about integrating into the filter of apple's devices and capabilities.  Rabbit is poorly designed and cannot improve itself because it lacks the ability to provide feedback to the AI.  When they design the products and services including apple, there has to be at least 2 options to where it can tailor solutions to it unless there is a certain solution like in maths as the best feedback is that it is wrong.  If there is an idiocracy movie, it is that we all become so reliant on AI that no one checks the answer to a math problem and everyone just takes AI's word for it and the math problem is completely wrong.  That is a problem., i am not looking forward to this massive push of AI. I do not want AI controlling my life. Apple already knows way to much stuff about me now they want to add features that would gain complete access to my phone and all my information. Imagine the cyber attack that could be pulled off if intergrade AI into everything we do. I am not against newer tech, Just wish it wasn't be mass pushed to onto the public like this. Apple says its safe with lots of security features but anyone ever think they just say this shit to sell the product.  The kids growing up on this stuff will be dumbest era of humans ever. AI has grown so fast in the last 2 years that it will replace humans. Please tell me what is the goal for AI other then to replace human and human errors.

Best of luck younger generations to come because I cant see a world where you will be able to survive., 10:41~11:03 \"They'd say anything else -- Neural Nets, Machine Learning .. But people want to hear Apple talk about AI.\" \\nJesus F*cking Christ Almighty , As someone with an AI degree this is the kind of thing that puts a shotgun shell in my hope for humanity. This is literally the equivalent of an Auto Manufacturer talking about Engines, Wheels, Body Paint, Dashes, Leather Seats, and Safety Features, and the public going \"We don't want to hear about that boring stuff, get with the times we want to you to talk about CARS!\" Like my Brother In Christ WHAT DO YOU THINK A CAR F*CKING IS ??????????? \\n\\nWith that rant out of the way, I trust Apple, and I trust Meta with AI. I ABSOLUTELY do Not trust Google Or Microsoft (ChatGPT) with AI -- They've both already rushed to release literal garbage that's genuinely hilarious in how bad it is. ChatGPT peaked a while ago and is getting worse with time, and OpenAI is an Extremely Shady company. Apple does a WAY better job at this kind of thing, as does Meta in a different way. I can see myself disabling ChatGPT as a possible option if given the chance, and exclusively using Apple's homegrown systems. Meta's Llama is what happens when you let the people who ACTUALLY understand AI , and competent developers in a large competent corporate structure, design and create the thing instead of the Executives who's understanding of AI is about as deep as you can dig into concrete.]</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>30</th>\n      <td>29</td>\n      <td>71</td>\n      <td>29_marques_samsung_reading_notes</td>\n      <td>[marques, samsung, reading, notes, funny, list, gal, iconic, video, updates]</td>\n      <td>[Love how marques is reading the apple updates through an android phone, As Marques is reading his notes of a Samsung Ultra. 😂, Love how Marques is reading all the new iPhone features off of an android. 😂]</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>31</th>\n      <td>30</td>\n      <td>70</td>\n      <td>30_conference_keynotes_platforms_fest</td>\n      <td>[conference, keynotes, platforms, fest, hour, script, performative, showcase, watched, leap]</td>\n      <td>[This was not the best keynote.

Would be nice to have more filter options for instance filter images that were “saved” or downloaded from the web or even a specific filter for photos saved from google drive or Dropbox etc.\\n\\nOne of the HUGE ideas I came up with is in the main “recents” album (what I use most when I’m browsing my photos) is a way to bulk up photos within that view into one square/icon IE if you take consecutive videos or photos at a concert, you could select the string of photos to compile into a single “folder” of sorts WITHIN the gallery view that way there isn’t 10-20+ photos taking up large chunks of the photo grid. Another example is when I take product photos of items to sell on eBay/marketplace, there’s 50+ photos back to back that take up my gallery that bury all my other day to day photos and videos. Putting them in an album is great to just access those product photos but when I’m browsing for general photos/videos, it’s very stressful seeing them take up so much space.\\n\\nHopefully you can visualize what I’m saying. \\n\\nCheers, please still my idea Apple 👍]</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>54</th>\n      <td>53</td>\n      <td>45</td>\n      <td>53_rabbit_r1_pin_scam</td>\n      <td>[rabbit, r1, pin, scam, rip, humain, homicide, oooommggggg, doordash, burying]</td>\n      <td>[so no need for a rabbit 🤣, RIP - Humane Pin and Rabbit R1, Do I still need a rabbit r1?]</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>55</th>\n      <td>54</td>\n      <td>45</td>\n      <td>54_lock_passcode_secret_app</td>\n      <td>[lock, passcode, secret, app, modes, flash, button, disable, shortcuts, focus]</td>\n      <td>[Finally I can hide my age by not accidentally hitting the flashlight button on my lock screen., Finally app lock, Still no app lock?]</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>56</th>\n      <td>55</td>\n      <td>45</td>\n      <td>55_hotel_lighting_studio_manages</td>\n      <td>[hotel, lighting, studio, manages, quality, amazing, hostage, filmed, setup, posh]</td>\n      <td>[Video lighting and quality looks so so good for an hotel room!!!, Man the lighting in your hotel room is crazy, The lighting in your hotel room.

I think there's an inherent distrust in the avg consumers view of ai, Yes it is a big feature. And it's unlucky that it supports the last four generations of M chips, but only one generation of iPhone chip. Well it will actually be two by the time it's ready.\\n\\nBut we were happily living without it until now. Newer iPhones having it doesn't suddenly make your iPhone any worse than it currently is.\\n\\nAnd I think some people might overrate how often would they actually use it.

I bought an Android as a second phone to experience the other side, and out of all the features on Android, that was the one that stood out to me. Because there are times when I want to send a message late at night, and it’s not appropriate to send it to a colleague at that time. So, scheduling for the future when I have time makes sense so that it reaches the recipient at a time appropriate for them.

It’s Shot on iPhone. Unless you can prove that other recording devices were used, the statement is completely and totally true and accurate. Nowhere did Apple claim they didn’t use dolleys and cranes, storage capture devices, etc. In fact they ADVERTISED that they used that stuff. \\n\\nYour opinion is your opinion and that’s valid, but the world has moved on from the faux outrage select “publications” manufactured about this. It was and is Shot on iPhone. And yes, you can get stunning video with zero equipment. But as I said in my reply:\\n\\n&gt;You can still produce excellent video without thousands of dollars worth of equipment. But if your argument here is trying to say that Apple wouldn't have taken advantage of the iPhone and all the clout that Shot on iPhone would bring if Equipment was the only thing barring it from producing Hollywood quality video…..\\n\\nEquipment is a third of the equation in a professional production, the other third being the recording device, and the last third being the professionals working on it, directing it, editing it, etc., The known iPhone rigs Apple actually used in the past are mostly rigs that allow for attaching data storage and power. External recording only enables 4K 60fps, which is probably not needed nor desired for most shots (where you want to use more normal frame rates). So it doesn’t change a thing concerning image quality, just adds convenience. (No power loss. Easily work with the captured data.)\\n\\nAlso, the rigs allow Apple to attach the phones to stuff that moves the camera around, allowing for good camera movement. This, however, does not correct for a deficiency of the iPhone camera. Any camera, no matter how expensive, can’t magically move on its own and create those camera moves. It will be attached to the very same equipment to move it around.\\n\\nThat equipment makes for great camera moves and that does improve the footage, sure, but that’s down to the movement equipment, not the camera, no matter the camera.\\n\\nObviously Apple uses artificial lighting equipment. As they should. Because light is obviously decisive when it comes to filming and will massively improve images. But Apple would use lighting no matter the camera. So all the same things apply to lighting that also apply to camera movement. Improves the footage, sure, but that’s down to the lighting equipment, not the camera, no matter the camera.\\n\\nI haven’t seen Apple attach lenses to the iPhone. Probably because it’s a bad idea and will degrade image quality. Attaching different lenses would really only make sense if you could remove the original lenses. Which you can’t. So Apple doesn’t do it.\\n\\nShooting on an iPhone severely limits art direction. It limits how you can work with depth field. It probably limits your dynamic range, meaning certain shots are just not possible. It limits the focal lengths you can use. These are all severe limitations that no attached equipment can solve.\\n\\nThis isn’t so simple. You cannot magically attach equipment to a camera to get any result you want., I’m curious why that matters. Is RED or an Alexa somehow compromised because of all of the lenses, dolleys, and equipment attached to it? I have zero clue why the equipment attached to it matters. Apple couldn’t film it with previous iPhones even though they were generally great for video. Now Apple can with all the improvements made to the camera, including Log recording. The fact that no one even knew it was shot on iPhone until they stated it at the Mac event goes to show how far video on iPhone has come. You can still produce excellent video without thousands of dollars worth of equipment. But if your argument here is trying to say that Apple wouldn't have taken advantage of the iPhone and all the clout that Shot on iPhone would bring if Equipment was the only thing barring it from producing Hollywood quality video…..]</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>111</th>\n      <td>110</td>\n      <td>17</td>\n      <td>110_intro_song_immaculate_deja</td>\n      <td>[intro, song, immaculate, deja, tommisch, persona, eminem, omfg, fear, away]</td>\n      <td>[song choice is immaculate for the intro how long is *AWT37X* opened to us?, song choice is immaculate for the intro, intro song choice was immaculate]</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>112</th>\n      <td>111</td>\n      <td>17</td>\n      <td>111_subscribed_overtake_deserved_palm</td>\n      <td>[subscribed, overtake, deserved, palm, rober, jist, moly, surpassing, mrwhosetheboss, goat]</td>\n      <td>[\"I believe we are catching up to Apple in subscribers, it would be kinda nice if we passed them, that would be sick\" You got that from Mrwhosetheboss didn't you lol, Wow, almost passed Apple on subscribers!

really impressed by the continuity features, I'm most of the way into the Apple ecosystem, I use a personal Mac, iPad, Apple TV, and even a work iPhone (plus everyone else in my life has an iPhone so...) \\n\\nHowever, I've used an Android as my personal phone for nearly 15 years now, and do really enjoy android. And since the majority of the day I'm on my work PC, I like that it has always been a pretty good middle man between the Mac and Windows world. \\n\\nBut hot damn, just the iPhone Mirroring feature alone makes me think I'm finally going to make the switch to the iPhone side.

on the new iPad Pro's while still being saddled with iPad OS.  Give the iPad Pro Mac OS and use the standard phone based OS for the other iPad's.  I think I'll go MacBook Air and ditch the iPad going forward., Just give us Mac OS on iPad, All they need to do to make the new iPad the best IPad is 🥁. . . Give it Mac OS 🎉.]  \n12

Even if they say that iDevice data won't be logged on OpenAI's servers, users might still not want their data to be sent there, requiring the additional verification step in between.\\n\\nI'd at least like to see an option to auto-allow transmitting data to ChatGPT, eliminating that extra step which would probably improve the integration for users who don't care about their data being sent to Sam., If I upgrade to a new device, would all these LLM models, trained data transfer there as well?\\nIf yes, does that mean there is some data that is being stored in Apple Servers?, Apple: We take privacy very seriously, as much as possible AI features will use device hardware and not the cloud. \\r\\nAlso Apple: When you use GPT4o your data will be sent to OpenAI/Microsoft. \\r\\nAlso Apple:

I have to bail to the browser and let Google show me the word I was trying to type up.  Pathetic., Gonna spend hours writing something and asking Apple to rewrite it to sound professional and then sobbing uncontrollably because I thought I already sounded professional but Apple's AI is

These models are really RAM hungry, I think it's insane that the only iPhone that will get these features are the iPhone 15 Pro. I think this shows that 'TOPS' for AI features and neural engines is far less important than RAM and GPU cores. The A16 Bionic has 17 TOPS vs M1's 11 TOPS, but the M1 starts at 8gb ram and has far more capable graphics than A16 Bionic. A17 Pro has the additional GPU core as well as 8gb RAM. The A16 Bionic has 6gb RAM and a less powerful GPU. I wonder if this is indicative of Apple feeling the pressure to catch up on AI features because it's wild that if you bought and iPhone, an Mac, and and iPad together in the last few years, this feature is only going to work on 2/3 of those devices and it's not going to be your iPhone which has the the most personal data to draw from., Not enough ram]  \n35

[Odd... I can't seem to replicate the graph they showed on the Math Notes. If you leave x as the unknown, while leaving all the other variables as their values written in red, then you get almost a flat line. If you leave A as the unknown, since the video showed the user changing A with a slider, then you get a periodic function due to the sin. In any case, I couldn't seem to get a parabola as displayed in the video.\\n\\n\\n(If I made an error, please correct me.), are math notes coming to iphone calculator app?, math note is not a calculator, it is a separate thing, they even added it to the notes, calculator is the same as in iPhone, they're just trying to confuse everyone, they could've done the calculator a long time ago. there are apps that do the same thing, math note is a great SEPARATE app :)]  \n40

chance Apple was going to allow you to generate realistic images, that’s a massive can of worms they definitely don’t want to open any time soon. \\n\\nEven just allowing people to generate arbitrary images in a cartoony style is a huge risk they’re taking, for a company that usually puts huge guardrails to stop users doing anything too weird in their apps. Even in it’s current incarnation people are going to try and break it, testing to see what kind of cursed looking abominations the system currently allows., Also, the generated images look terrible, clip-art level quality at best, so I’m not too worried about people taking these images and trying to pass it off as their own work. Apple seems to be deliberately avoiding the state-of-the-art on that front, which is probably a good thing., >I have yet to see any AI generated image that looks anywhere close to good. \\n\\nI have no way to prove this of course, but I bet you've seen good AI images and simply had no idea that's what you were looking at. These services can absolutely generate images indistinguishable from real life. In this case (and others) the images are stylized for branding purposes and also it takes a lot less computing power.]  \n55

I’ve been using the Things app and reminders along with the calendar. Seems like I should have been using Fantastical., While it may seem like a minor update, I'm so happy with the new UI updates in the Calendar app as well as its integration with Apple Reminders. \\n\\nI can finally ditch Fantastical!, >I can finally ditch Fantastical!\\n\\nUnless you use any of the advanced features, then you maybe still can’t.  \\n\\nI see an all day task in the screen shots for iOS 18. Fantastical gives you the option to not show those and only show tasks with a time. You can also choose which Reminders lists show in the Calendar. Hopefully Apple offers that. You have calendar sets where you can pick & choose which calendars and reminders lists are shown together in different situations. \\n\\nAnother benefit for me is that Fantastical is always in the Share Sheet so I can create a calendar event or reminder from anywhere in iOS. It is context dependent whether Calendar or Reminders is in the share sheet, so I find myself using the Fantastical option quite often.\\n\\nThen of course there is the natural language entry for both calendar events and reminders in Fantastical. \\n\\nI will be definitely be curious to see how Apple’s changes compare to what is available in Fantastical.]  \n59

there’s news in tech?….i watched an entire video on this exact same subject yesterday that was longer so I knew it covered all of the same things…but still left that video and immediately came here to see his take on it…and it wasn’t here yet…but then the moment I saw this this morning I was eager to watch it as if it were a cinematic release or something.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat being said…I wonder if AI is gonna bring objectivity back to America…like help ppl keep their statements grammatically correct and then do a quick search before they post them and give an alert that they’re about to make an incorrect statement…I think that would be cool.]  \n63

please folks, it is not the first to do it. Microsoft's AI math calculator app has been out for over 9 years. Apple just made theirs a little better., 8:33 Anyone that uses Microsoft apps knows that the Math app from Microsoft already does all this. Had it on my iPad for a couple years now. It can scan, write or just be a calculator. I use it on my iphone as my primary calculator app. Because the stock app sucks., Ok.. Am I the only one who thinks maths note isn't a new thing? \\nI have forgotten the name of the app.. I used it a whole lot back in college, this was at least 10 years ago now. \\n\\nI was blown away as to how it could do maths from me writing it out, even when I wasn't able to write well. \\n\\nThis was when android was very very very early, like I said, 10 years ago now at least. \\n\\nBut I guess they didn't really market their app well, then companies weren't really super crazy about marketing as they are now, maybe that's why. \\n\\nBut it literally did what apple showed off with the calculator app..]  \n64

summary.\\nSteve Jobs brought us keywords, sort & rules to let us select our photos for our smart albums in iPhotos almost 20 years ago. We need keywords back for iOS.  IS there anything in WWDC24 to help us organize our photos with keywords, metadata and use it to select and organize our photos.  Memories is great. We need to access our photos ourselves as well.., Photo app still needs so much work. Would be nice to have more filter options for instance filter images that were “saved” or downloaded from the web or even a specific filter for photos saved from google drive or Dropbox etc.\\n\\nOne of the HUGE ideas I came up with is in the main “recents” album (what I use most when I’m browsing my photos) is a way to bulk up photos within that view into one square/icon IE if you take consecutive videos or photos at a concert, you could select the string of photos to compile into a single “folder” of sorts WITHIN the gallery view that way there isn’t 10-20+ photos taking up large chunks of the photo grid. Another example is when I take product photos of items to sell on eBay/marketplace, there’s 50+ photos back to back that take up my gallery that bury all my other day to day photos and videos. Putting them in an album is great to just access those product photos but when I’m browsing for general photos/videos, it’s very stressful seeing them take up so much space.\\n\\nHopefully you can visualize what I’m saying. \\n\\nCheers, please still my idea Apple 👍, Thanks for your great recap.\\nSteve Jobs brought us keywords, sort & rules to let us select our photos for our smart albums in iPhotos almost 20 years ago.

As we develop more sophisticated processing powers, it will allow us to make better and better systems.  We have the sizes of the devices optimized but soon we will see it able to do more.  That is why it is not artificial intelligence because it is about integrating into the filter of apple's devices and capabilities.  Rabbit is poorly designed and cannot improve itself because it lacks the ability to provide feedback to the AI.  When they design the products and services including apple, there has to be at least 2 options to where it can tailor solutions to it unless there is a certain solution like in maths as the best feedback is that it is wrong.  If there is an idiocracy movie, it is that we all become so reliant on AI that no one checks the answer to a math problem and everyone just takes AI's word for it and the math problem is completely wrong.  That is a problem., I actually appreciate that Apple refuses to call this technology \"A.I.\", because it definitively, unequivocably is *not* \"artificial intelligence\". I'm not saying the technology isn't interesting and potentially useful (if implemented ethically, which currently none of it is), but it's not \"A.I.\" It shows a streak of integrity from Apple that they would not succumb to marketing hype to literally lie to people about the tech.\\n\\nI'm also impressed that they managed to find a marketing spin that allowed them to draw in all the folks who've fallen for the false terminology while still creating a phrase that doesn't, technically, call it \"artificial intelligence\".\\n\\nI genuinely wish Silicon Valley would just drop \"A.I.\" from its spin machine and get another name for this tech, so it stops getting conflated with the actual science of developing true A.I., It is mildly pleasing that Apple seems to know the difference between artificial intelligence and machine \"learning\". However, being clever at marketing it uses its brand name, beginning with 'A' and links it the broad term \"intelligence\".\\nThus, the craze for muddled ideas about what AI is, in strict definitions, can continue and Apple gets to claim a slice of the whole shebang with clever electronics seeming to be new when they are really extensions/evolution of machine \"learning\". \\nThere is no dishonesty, merely more colorful and responsive fog and a significant step forward to the demise of x-86.]  \n98

already did for a long time., I'm really impressed by the continuity features, I'm most of the way into the Apple ecosystem, I use a personal Mac, iPad, Apple TV, and even a work iPhone (plus everyone

We need to access our photos ourselves as well.., Photo app still needs so much work. Would be nice to have more filter options for instance filter images that were “saved” or downloaded from the web or even a specific filter for photos saved from google drive or Dropbox etc.\\n\\nOne of the HUGE ideas I came up with is in the main “recents” album (what I use most when I’m browsing my photos) is a way to bulk up photos within that view into one square/icon IE if you take consecutive videos or photos at a concert, you could select the string of photos to compile into a single “folder” of sorts WITHIN the gallery view that way there isn’t 10-20+ photos taking up large chunks of the photo grid. Another example is when I take product photos of items to sell on eBay/marketplace, there’s 50+ photos back to back that take up my gallery that bury all my other day to day photos and videos. Putting them in an album is great to just access those product photos but when I’m browsing for general photos/videos, it’s very stressful seeing them take up so much space.\\n\\nHopefully you can visualize what I’m saying. \\n\\nCheers, please still my idea Apple 👍, Thanks for your great recap.\\nSteve Jobs brought us keywords, sort &amp; rules to let us select our photos for our smart albums in iPhotos almost 20 years ago.

As we develop more sophisticated processing powers, it will allow us to make better and better systems.  We have the sizes of the devices optimized but soon we will see it able to do more.  That is why it is not artificial intelligence because it is about integrating into the filter of apple's devices and capabilities.  Rabbit is poorly designed and cannot improve itself because it lacks the ability to provide feedback to the AI.  When they design the products and services including apple, there has to be at least 2 options to where it can tailor solutions to it unless there is a certain solution like in maths as the best feedback is that it is wrong.  If there is an idiocracy movie, it is that we all become so reliant on AI that no one checks the answer to a math problem and everyone just takes AI's word for it and the math problem is completely wrong.  That is a problem., I actually appreciate that Apple refuses to call this technology \"A.I.\", because it definitively, unequivocably is *not* \"artificial intelligence\". I'm not saying the technology isn't interesting and potentially useful (if implemented ethically, which currently none of it is), but it's not \"A.I.\" It shows a streak of integrity from Apple that they would not succumb to marketing hype to literally lie to people about the tech.\\n\\nI'm also impressed that they managed to find a marketing spin that allowed them to draw in all the folks who've fallen for the false terminology while still creating a phrase that doesn't, technically, call it \"artificial intelligence\".\\n\\nI genuinely wish Silicon Valley would just drop \"A.I.\" from its spin machine and get another name for this tech, so it stops getting conflated with the actual science of developing true A.I., It is mildly pleasing that Apple seems to know the difference between artificial intelligence and machine \"learning\". However, being clever at marketing it uses its brand name, beginning with 'A' and links it the broad term \"intelligence\".\\nThus, the craze for muddled ideas about what AI is, in strict definitions, can continue and Apple gets to claim a slice of the whole shebang with clever electronics seeming to be new when they are really extensions/evolution of machine \"learning\". \\nThere is no dishonesty, merely more colorful and responsive fog and a significant step forward to the demise of x-86.]</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>98</th>\n      <td>97</td>\n      <td>15</td>\n      <td>97_subscribers_youtube_20m_tryna</td>\n      <td>[subscribers, youtube, 20m, tryna, subbed, overtake, mkbhd, mrwhosetheboss, wwdc24, apple]</td>\n      <td>[Imagine a channel that’s reviews Apple products has more subscribers than Apple itself is crazy, You have less subscribers than YouTube?

Hats off to the developers working crazy hours to make the features announced a reality.  \n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               My take on WWDC's iPad calculator app: It's nothing more than a gimmick WWDC just dropped yesterday and one of the highlight features was the calculator app feature. MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world. Ok, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks: It’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. You can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly. It can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want. You can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers. The features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools? The first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  In this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. Anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire   That calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad. The second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? Finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. You don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. This reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). It’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. Other examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.  \n2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I will never understand these chucklefucks trying to sell VR as a productivity tool at this stage in its development. Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face. ==================================== My requirements for a phone are actually quite simple:  -a camera with acceptable image quality -no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display -stereo front-facing speakers -a headphone jack as backup for when I need it -expandable storage for when I need it -the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS Thus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone. ==================================== Okay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see. ==================================== I honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet. ==================================== I'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.  \n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Summarized by AskTube WWDC Keynote Highlights 📱 00:02 Apple's WWDC keynote was filled with exciting announcements, including a surprise introduction to AI in the second half. 00:25 The author live-tweeted the event and summarizes all the key announcements and thoughts.

How Apple Handles Complex AI Tasks 💻 15:10 Apple handles most AI tasks on-device, using Apple-built models for faster processing. However, for complex tasks, Apple has two alternative approaches. 15:32 One approach uses a larger server-based model on Apple's Private Cloud compute, ensuring data is not stored or sent to Apple, but may have downsides like slower processing and internet dependence. 15:54 The other approach asks the user for permission to use ChatGPT, allowing access to its capabilities and generating more realistic and varied images. Privacy and Security of AI Features 🔒 16:18 Apple ensures privacy and security by not storing requests, obscuring IP addresses, and preventing OpenAI from forming a profile.

I already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions.  I could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter! I just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro.  This came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\" I already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup.  Apple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels. Softwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works. So, I'm out, except for Mac.  \n5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           **Lots** of great updates. There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance: 1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri. 2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap. 3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat. 4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.   5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.) 6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.) I get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.  \n6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Romans 3:23 states: \"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;\". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 \"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\". Romans 10:13 states \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\". \\r \\r    Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.  \n7

iphone would have apple intelligence and in the end they said only iphone 15 pro models, is like... 😂 okay apple, not all people can afford a 1100 and 1300 dollars usd smartphones, thanks, steve jobs said that apple is for the humanity and to give them technology to improve people's lifes, apple had vision, tim cook did it until 2018, then everything has go slowly downhill, not all of it of course, but very down, not only that, but jobs said that according to our efforts we decide the price of our products, we try the most to price it correctly, well that was in 2009, and for your knowledge, apple intelligence is only available for 2 iphones (of more than 24 iphones eligible for the ios 18 update *oh is because they don't have 6gb of ram, well darling the Android phone of my Granny costs 200 dollars and has 8gb of ddr4 ram and on screen ai analysis to summarize websites with Gemini for free -well you exchange your data even when they say no but i don't believe any company in terms of 100% privacy so it's meh for me, is logic, that's why USA gov wants to ban TikTok cuz they don't have control over their info and the excuse is that they are \"spies\"-, apple does not use a \"unique physical ram\" to justify their price, like i say.. thefts*) but hey you have good animations :D and \"the ecosystem\" that windows and android are reaching more fast than ever to the point of apple, apple= no moral and respectful for people's money and time (so contrary to Steve's apple), yeah they have good and incredible things like the integration of apple intelligence offline but it doesn't help the fact that whenever they do something great they put it like god's new technology to justify prices in this times when they are not the unique smartphone company they were in 2007-2018, others are in the same level or little lower or little higher than them in terms of technology, i hope that the apple directive is changed but that will not happen because money runs the world and if they are still selling, nothing will change.  P.d. They said thar A17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really? They always said new processors of apple silicon are the most fastest in the world all the time, the processor of the iphone 14 pro max is slow? Gosh they are really inmoral capitalists (i agree with capitalism and liberal economies)  \n8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            My first impression is definitely that they’re playing catch-up, in terms of QoL features. They could’ve done this back in iOS 14 at once, there’s no reason to take 4 years to incorporate all these features. Summarization was already available on Mac, I’ve sent numerous feature requests, asking them to bring it system-wide to iPads and iPhones. This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray. I predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that.  The only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”.  This isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability.  Last time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected.  Furthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac.  - why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing?  Another thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got: - better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago) - Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind.  A few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.  \n9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I want to thank you for always giving us a well thought videos. Others spend time babbling and trying to be funny and you sound like a tech guy giving us tech news. I have a suggestion to take you to a new level. I have been writing Apple for years. I honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. I’ll share them in a moment. By the way I am a software engineer. I am not one who thinks I am so D smart or the smarted person in the room. I love to always learn and ai find I am always learning new things from you. So my idea for you is a real tech news Channel. This will make you something like the Wal Mart of tech news. This idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. I tried to float this to Apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. We have CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iPhone is released. Tech news is happening every day all day. I say join forces with some of the best like yourself, Brian Tong, possibly some from Engadget and create a real Tech News channel. It’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. EVs and Republicans wanting to K EVs, TicTok, Twitter. With social media companies being as influential as they have become. They’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. A real tech news channel will do this. What you and others do is journalism. I want the news to still be fun but I want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a CNN. You will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech CEO’s. It’s a militia billion. Dollar idea I am giving to you. This is something new of its kind and needed. Tech is no longer just mobile. We have stepped into the world of AI and Humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will I pack them. I would love to work with you as a producer or something. I have a huge idea and it will work.

What a day, this was probably the most jam packed WWDC I have watched in a long time. They definitely went deeper on integration that I thought they would. Hats off to the developers working crazy hours to make the features announced a reality.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>@flowting5163</td>\n      <td>1246</td>\n      <td>My take on WWDC's iPad calculator app: It's nothing more than a gimmick WWDC just dropped yesterday and one of the highlight features was the calculator app feature. MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world. Ok, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks: It’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. You can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly. It can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want. You can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers. The features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools? The first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  In this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. Anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire   That calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad. The second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? Finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. You don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. This reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). It’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. Other examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>@mndlessdrwer</td>\n      <td>763</td>\n      <td>I will never understand these chucklefucks trying to sell VR as a productivity tool at this stage in its development.

Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face. ==================================== My requirements for a phone are actually quite simple:  -a camera with acceptable image quality -no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display -stereo front-facing speakers -a headphone jack as backup for when I need it -expandable storage for when I need it -the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS Thus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone. ==================================== Okay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see. ==================================== I honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet. ==================================== I'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>@ThuanSuBa</td>\n      <td>707</td>\n      <td>Summarized by AskTube WWDC Keynote Highlights 📱 00:02 Apple's WWDC keynote was filled with exciting announcements, including a surprise introduction to AI in the second half. 00:25 The author live-tweeted the event and summarizes all the key announcements and thoughts. Vision OS 2.0 📊 00:47 Vision OS 2.0 brings new features like wrist-turn gestures to see time and battery percentage, and quick access to the control center. 01:05 New Immersive Media Features: Turn old photos into spatial photos using advanced machine learning, and create spatial videos on non-iPhone cameras. iOS Updates 📱 02:29 iOS got a major update with customizable home screens, icon placement, and a new theme engine. 02:54 Customize your home screen with different colors, and change icon and widget colors to match your wallpaper. Other Updates 📊 03:37 Mac mirroring gets a higher resolution, and new tools are available for creating spatial and immersive videos. 04:00 New features include scheduling text messages, text formatting, a game mode that minimizes background activity, and automatic categorization in the new mail app. AirPods and Apple TV Updates 🎧 06:05 AirPods got minor updates, including voice isolation during phone calls, spatial audio during games, and nodding or shaking for responding to prompts. 06:25 Apple TV updates include showing actors' and characters' names on screen and boosting people's voices over the music. iPad OS Updates 📊 06:41 iPad OS allows remote control of someone's iPad with their permission, perfect for family tech support. 07:03 The calculator app on iPad OS is impressive, letting you write equations in handwriting and getting real-time answers. Mac OS Updates 📊 09:40 Mac OS got a new version called Sequoia, featuring automatic window snapping, built-in backgrounds for webcam feeds, and a new password app. Apple Intelligence AI 🤖 10:40 Apple rebranded AI as Apple Intelligence, bringing new generative models and large language models to supported devices. 11:01 Apple Intelligence features include writing tools, a cleanup tool in Photos, and generative emojis. How Apple Handles Complex AI Tasks 💻 15:10 Apple handles most AI tasks on-device, using Apple-built models for faster processing. However, for complex tasks, Apple has two alternative approaches. 15:32 One approach uses a larger server-based model on Apple's Private Cloud compute, ensuring data is not stored or sent to Apple, but may have downsides like slower processing and internet dependence. 15:54 The other approach asks the user for permission to use ChatGPT, allowing access to its capabilities and generating more realistic and varied images. Privacy and Security of AI Features 🔒 16:18 Apple ensures privacy and security by not storing requests, obscuring IP addresses, and preventing OpenAI from forming a profile. All this is done without an account and for free. Insights on Apple's AI Announcements 🤔 17:01 The author believes Apple's AI features are superior, with personalization and existing user info making them more effective. 17:25 The AI announcements overshadow other features, marking a new age for Apple, and the author is excited to explore its capabilities and what it can bring to users. Conclusion and Future Content 📹 18:06 The author will create more videos about Apple's AI features and encourages viewers to subscribe for updates.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>kasakka1</td>\n      <td>557</td>\n      <td>My takeaway was that across MacOS, iOS and iPadOS I found very few things that I could tell I would include in my daily use. I already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions.  I could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter! I just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro.  This came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\" I already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup.  Apple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels. Softwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works. So, I'm out, except for Mac.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>5</th>\n      <td>KLM_SpitFire</td>\n      <td>555</td>\n      <td>**Lots** of great updates. There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance: 1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri. 2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap. 3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat. 4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.   5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.) 6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.) I get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>6</th>\n      <td>@johnpearson1258</td>\n      <td>553</td>\n      <td>Romans 3:23 states: \"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;\". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 \"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\". Romans 10:13 states \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\". \\r \\r    Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>7</th>\n      <td>@lellmajar</td>\n      <td>544</td>\n      <td>Not only that, for most of the presentation they did say that iphone would have apple intelligence and in the end they said only iphone 15 pro models, is like... 😂 okay apple, not all people can afford a 1100 and 1300 dollars usd smartphones, thanks, steve jobs said that apple is for the humanity and to give them technology to improve people's lifes, apple had vision, tim cook did it until 2018, then everything has go slowly downhill, not all of it of course, but very down, not only that, but jobs said that according to our efforts we decide the price of our products, we try the most to price it correctly, well that was in 2009, and for your knowledge, apple intelligence is only available for 2 iphones (of more than 24 iphones eligible for the ios 18 update *oh is because they don't have 6gb of ram, well darling the Android phone of my Granny costs 200 dollars and has 8gb of ddr4 ram and on screen ai analysis to summarize websites with Gemini for free -well you exchange your data even when they say no but i don't believe any company in terms of 100% privacy so it's meh for me, is logic, that's why USA gov wants to ban TikTok cuz they don't have control over their info and the excuse is that they are \"spies\"-, apple does not use a \"unique physical ram\" to justify their price, like i say.. thefts*) but hey you have good animations :D and \"the ecosystem\" that windows and android are reaching more fast than ever to the point of apple, apple= no moral and respectful for people's money and time (so contrary to Steve's apple), yeah they have good and incredible things like the integration of apple intelligence offline but it doesn't help the fact that whenever they do something great they put it like god's new technology to justify prices in this times when they are not the unique smartphone company they were in 2007-2018, others are in the same level or little lower or little higher than them in terms of technology, i hope that the apple directive is changed but that will not happen because money runs the world and if they are still selling, nothing will change.  P.d. They said thar A17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really? They always said new processors of apple silicon are the most fastest in the world all the time, the processor of the iphone 14 pro max is slow?

They could’ve done this back in iOS 14 at once, there’s no reason to take 4 years to incorporate all these features. Summarization was already available on Mac, I’ve sent numerous feature requests, asking them to bring it system-wide to iPads and iPhones. This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray. I predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that.  The only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”.  This isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability.  Last time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected.  Furthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac.  - why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing?  Another thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got: - better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago) - Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind.  A few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>9</th>\n      <td>@madboyreadynow28</td>\n      <td>466</td>\n      <td>I want to thank you for always giving us a well thought videos. Others spend time babbling and trying to be funny and you sound like a tech guy giving us tech news. I have a suggestion to take you to a new level. I have been writing Apple for years. I honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. I’ll share them in a moment. By the way I am a software engineer. I am not one who thinks I am so D smart or the smarted person in the room. I love to always learn and ai find I am always learning new things from you. So my idea for you is a real tech news Channel. This will make you something like the Wal Mart of tech news. This idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. I tried to float this to Apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. We have CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iPhone is released. Tech news is happening every day all day. I say join forces with some of the best like yourself, Brian Tong, possibly some from Engadget and create a real Tech News channel. It’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. EVs and Republicans wanting to K EVs, TicTok, Twitter. With social media companies being as influential as they have become. They’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. A real tech news channel will do this. What you and others do is journalism. I want the news to still be fun but I want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a CNN. You will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech CEO’s. It’s a militia billion. Dollar idea I am giving to you. This is something new of its kind and needed. Tech is no longer just mobile. We have stepped into the world of AI and Humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will I pack them. I would love to work with you as a producer or something. I have a huge idea and it will work.</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"466 is the number of tokens closest to 450 and still exceeding it.

MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world. Ok, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks: It’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. You can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly. It can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want. You can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers. The features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools? The first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  In this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. Anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire   That calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad. The second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? Finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. You don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. This reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). It’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. Other examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.   \n2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I will never understand these chucklefucks trying to sell VR as a productivity tool at this stage in its development. Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face. ==================================== My requirements for a phone are actually quite simple:  -a camera with acceptable image quality -no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display -stereo front-facing speakers -a headphone jack as backup for when I need it -expandable storage for when I need it -the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS Thus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone. ==================================== Okay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see. ==================================== I honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet. ==================================== I'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.   \n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Summarized by AskTube WWDC Keynote Highlights 📱 00:02 Apple's WWDC keynote was filled with exciting announcements, including a surprise introduction to AI in the second half. 00:25 The author live-tweeted the event and summarizes all the key announcements and thoughts.

How Apple Handles Complex AI Tasks 💻 15:10 Apple handles most AI tasks on-device, using Apple-built models for faster processing. However, for complex tasks, Apple has two alternative approaches. 15:32 One approach uses a larger server-based model on Apple's Private Cloud compute, ensuring data is not stored or sent to Apple, but may have downsides like slower processing and internet dependence. 15:54 The other approach asks the user for permission to use ChatGPT, allowing access to its capabilities and generating more realistic and varied images. Privacy and Security of AI Features 🔒 16:18 Apple ensures privacy and security by not storing requests, obscuring IP addresses, and preventing OpenAI from forming a profile.

I already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions.  I could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter! I just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro.  This came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\" I already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup.  Apple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels. Softwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works. So, I'm out, except for Mac.   \n5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           **Lots** of great updates. There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance: 1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri. 2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap. 3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat. 4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.   5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.) 6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.) I get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.   \n6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Romans 3:23 states: \"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;\". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 \"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\". Romans 10:13 states \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\". \\r \\r    Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.   \n7

iphone would have apple intelligence and in the end they said only iphone 15 pro models, is like... 😂 okay apple, not all people can afford a 1100 and 1300 dollars usd smartphones, thanks, steve jobs said that apple is for the humanity and to give them technology to improve people's lifes, apple had vision, tim cook did it until 2018, then everything has go slowly downhill, not all of it of course, but very down, not only that, but jobs said that according to our efforts we decide the price of our products, we try the most to price it correctly, well that was in 2009, and for your knowledge, apple intelligence is only available for 2 iphones (of more than 24 iphones eligible for the ios 18 update *oh is because they don't have 6gb of ram, well darling the Android phone of my Granny costs 200 dollars and has 8gb of ddr4 ram and on screen ai analysis to summarize websites with Gemini for free -well you exchange your data even when they say no but i don't believe any company in terms of 100% privacy so it's meh for me, is logic, that's why USA gov wants to ban TikTok cuz they don't have control over their info and the excuse is that they are \"spies\"-, apple does not use a \"unique physical ram\" to justify their price, like i say.. thefts*) but hey you have good animations :D and \"the ecosystem\" that windows and android are reaching more fast than ever to the point of apple, apple= no moral and respectful for people's money and time (so contrary to Steve's apple), yeah they have good and incredible things like the integration of apple intelligence offline but it doesn't help the fact that whenever they do something great they put it like god's new technology to justify prices in this times when they are not the unique smartphone company they were in 2007-2018, others are in the same level or little lower or little higher than them in terms of technology, i hope that the apple directive is changed but that will not happen because money runs the world and if they are still selling, nothing will change.  P.d. They said thar A17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really? They always said new processors of apple silicon are the most fastest in the world all the time, the processor of the iphone 14 pro max is slow? Gosh they are really inmoral capitalists (i agree with capitalism and liberal economies)   \n8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            My first impression is definitely that they’re playing catch-up, in terms of QoL features. They could’ve done this back in iOS 14 at once, there’s no reason to take 4 years to incorporate all these features. Summarization was already available on Mac, I’ve sent numerous feature requests, asking them to bring it system-wide to iPads and iPhones. This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray. I predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that.  The only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”.  This isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability.  Last time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected.  Furthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac.  - why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing?  Another thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got: - better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago) - Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind.  A few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.   \n9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I want to thank you for always giving us a well thought videos. Others spend time babbling and trying to be funny and you sound like a tech guy giving us tech news. I have a suggestion to take you to a new level. I have been writing Apple for years. I honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. I’ll share them in a moment. By the way I am a software engineer. I am not one who thinks I am so D smart or the smarted person in the room. I love to always learn and ai find I am always learning new things from you. So my idea for you is a real tech news Channel. This will make you something like the Wal Mart of tech news. This idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. I tried to float this to Apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. We have CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iPhone is released. Tech news is happening every day all day. I say join forces with some of the best like yourself, Brian Tong, possibly some from Engadget and create a real Tech News channel. It’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. EVs and Republicans wanting to K EVs, TicTok, Twitter. With social media companies being as influential as they have become. They’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. A real tech news channel will do this. What you and others do is journalism. I want the news to still be fun but I want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a CNN. You will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech CEO’s. It’s a militia billion. Dollar idea I am giving to you. This is something new of its kind and needed. Tech is no longer just mobile. We have stepped into the world of AI and Humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will I pack them. I would love to work with you as a producer or something. I have a huge idea and it will work.   \n\n   sent_count  \n0          11  \n1          51  \n2          18  \n3          26  \n4          25  \n5          37  \n6          28  \n7           7  \n8          16  \n9          31  ","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>author</th>\n      <th>num_tokens</th>\n      <th>processed_text</th>\n      <th>sent_count</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>hammerheadtiger</td>\n      <td>1375</td>\n      <td>Tim Cook is shouting from the roof, Craig and the exec team skydiving, Mike Rockwell in a Vision Pro, Apple video team budget at an all time high.

What a day, this was probably the most jam packed WWDC I have watched in a long time. They definitely went deeper on integration that I thought they would. Hats off to the developers working crazy hours to make the features announced a reality.</td>\n      <td>11</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>@flowting5163</td>\n      <td>1246</td>\n      <td>My take on WWDC's iPad calculator app: It's nothing more than a gimmick WWDC just dropped yesterday and one of the highlight features was the calculator app feature. MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world. Ok, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks: It’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. You can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly. It can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want. You can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers. The features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools? The first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  In this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. Anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire   That calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad. The second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? Finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. You don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. This reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). It’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. Other examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.</td>\n      <td>51</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>@mndlessdrwer</td>\n      <td>763</td>\n      <td>I will never understand these chucklefucks trying to sell VR as a productivity tool at this stage in its development. Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face. ==================================== My requirements for a phone are actually quite simple:  -a camera with acceptable image quality -no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display -stereo front-facing speakers -a headphone jack as backup for when I need it -expandable storage for when I need it -the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS Thus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone. ==================================== Okay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see. ==================================== I honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet. ==================================== I'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.</td>\n      <td>18</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>@ThuanSuBa</td>\n      <td>707</td>\n      <td>Summarized by AskTube WWDC Keynote Highlights 📱 00:02 Apple's WWDC keynote was filled with exciting announcements, including a surprise introduction to AI in the second half. 00:25 The author live-tweeted the event and summarizes all the key announcements and thoughts. Vision OS 2.0 📊 00:47 Vision OS 2.0 brings new features like wrist-turn gestures to see time and battery percentage, and quick access to the control center. 01:05 New Immersive Media Features: Turn old photos into spatial photos using advanced machine learning, and create spatial videos on non-iPhone cameras. iOS Updates 📱 02:29 iOS got a major update with customizable home screens, icon placement, and a new theme engine. 02:54 Customize your home screen with different colors, and change icon and widget colors to match your wallpaper. Other Updates 📊 03:37 Mac mirroring gets a higher resolution, and new tools are available for creating spatial and immersive videos. 04:00 New features include scheduling text messages, text formatting, a game mode that minimizes background activity, and automatic categorization in the new mail app. AirPods and Apple TV Updates 🎧 06:05 AirPods got minor updates, including voice isolation during phone calls, spatial audio during games, and nodding or shaking for responding to prompts. 06:25 Apple TV updates include showing actors' and characters' names on screen and boosting people's voices over the music. iPad OS Updates 📊 06:41 iPad OS allows remote control of someone's iPad with their permission, perfect for family tech support. 07:03 The calculator app on iPad OS is impressive, letting you write equations in handwriting and getting real-time answers. Mac OS Updates 📊 09:40 Mac OS got a new version called Sequoia, featuring automatic window snapping, built-in backgrounds for webcam feeds, and a new password app. Apple Intelligence AI 🤖 10:40 Apple rebranded AI as Apple Intelligence, bringing new generative models and large language models to supported devices. 11:01 Apple Intelligence features include writing tools, a cleanup tool in Photos, and generative emojis. How Apple Handles Complex AI Tasks 💻 15:10 Apple handles most AI tasks on-device, using Apple-built models for faster processing. However, for complex tasks, Apple has two alternative approaches. 15:32 One approach uses a larger server-based model on Apple's Private Cloud compute, ensuring data is not stored or sent to Apple, but may have downsides like slower processing and internet dependence. 15:54 The other approach asks the user for permission to use ChatGPT, allowing access to its capabilities and generating more realistic and varied images. Privacy and Security of AI Features 🔒 16:18 Apple ensures privacy and security by not storing requests, obscuring IP addresses, and preventing OpenAI from forming a profile. All this is done without an account and for free. Insights on Apple's AI Announcements 🤔 17:01 The author believes Apple's AI features are superior, with personalization and existing user info making them more effective. 17:25 The AI announcements overshadow other features, marking a new age for Apple, and the author is excited to explore its capabilities and what it can bring to users. Conclusion and Future Content 📹 18:06 The author will create more videos about Apple's AI features and encourages viewers to subscribe for updates.</td>\n      <td>26</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>kasakka1</td>\n      <td>557</td>\n      <td>My takeaway was that across MacOS, iOS and iPadOS I found very few things that I could tell I would include in my daily use. I already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions.  I could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter! I just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro.  This came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\" I already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup.  Apple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels. Softwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works. So, I'm out, except for Mac.</td>\n      <td>25</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>5</th>\n      <td>KLM_SpitFire</td>\n      <td>555</td>\n      <td>**Lots** of great updates. There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance: 1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri. 2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap. 3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat. 4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.   5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.) 6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.) I get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.</td>\n      <td>37</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>6</th>\n      <td>@johnpearson1258</td>\n      <td>553</td>\n      <td>Romans 3:23 states: \"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;\". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 \"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\". Romans 10:13 states \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\". \\r \\r    Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.</td>\n      <td>28</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>7</th>\n      <td>@lellmajar</td>\n      <td>544</td>\n      <td>Not only that, for most of the presentation they did say that iphone would have apple intelligence and in the end they said only iphone 15 pro models, is like... 😂 okay apple, not all people can afford a 1100 and 1300 dollars usd smartphones, thanks, steve jobs said that apple is for the humanity and to give them technology to improve people's lifes, apple had vision, tim cook did it until 2018, then everything has go slowly downhill, not all of it of course, but very down, not only that, but jobs said that according to our efforts we decide the price of our products, we try the most to price it correctly, well that was in 2009, and for your knowledge, apple intelligence is only available for 2 iphones (of more than 24 iphones eligible for the ios 18 update *oh is because they don't have 6gb of ram, well darling the Android phone of my Granny costs 200 dollars and has 8gb of ddr4 ram and on screen ai analysis to summarize websites with Gemini for free -well you exchange your data even when they say no but i don't believe any company in terms of 100% privacy so it's meh for me, is logic, that's why USA gov wants to ban TikTok cuz they don't have control over their info and the excuse is that they are \"spies\"-, apple does not use a \"unique physical ram\" to justify their price, like i say.. thefts*) but hey you have good animations :D and \"the ecosystem\" that windows and android are reaching more fast than ever to the point of apple, apple= no moral and respectful for people's money and time (so contrary to Steve's apple), yeah they have good and incredible things like the integration of apple intelligence offline but it doesn't help the fact that whenever they do something great they put it like god's new technology to justify prices in this times when they are not the unique smartphone company they were in 2007-2018, others are in the same level or little lower or little higher than them in terms of technology, i hope that the apple directive is changed but that will not happen because money runs the world and if they are still selling, nothing will change.  P.d. They said thar A17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really?

They could’ve done this back in iOS 14 at once, there’s no reason to take 4 years to incorporate all these features. Summarization was already available on Mac, I’ve sent numerous feature requests, asking them to bring it system-wide to iPads and iPhones. This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray. I predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that.  The only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”.  This isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability.  Last time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected.  Furthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac.  - why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing?  Another thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got: - better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago) - Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind.  A few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.</td>\n      <td>16</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>9</th>\n      <td>@madboyreadynow28</td>\n      <td>466</td>\n      <td>I want to thank you for always giving us a well thought videos.

MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world. Ok, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks: It’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. You can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly. It can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want. You can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers. The features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools? The first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  In this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. Anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire   That calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad. The second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? Finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. You don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. This reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). It’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. Other examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.\""},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Very nice condensed version of > 450 token comment.

We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 \"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\". Romans 10:13 states \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\". \\r \\r    Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.   \n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               My take on WWDC's iPad calculator app: It's nothing more than a gimmick WWDC just dropped yesterday and one of the highlight features was the calculator app feature. MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world. Ok, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks: It’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. You can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly. It can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want. You can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers. The features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools? The first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  In this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. Anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire   That calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad. The second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? Finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. You don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. This reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). It’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. Other examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.   \n2

                                                                                                         Not only that, for most of the presentation they did say that iphone would have apple intelligence and in the end they said only iphone 15 pro models, is like... 😂 okay apple, not all people can afford a 1100 and 1300 dollars usd smartphones, thanks, steve jobs said that apple is for the humanity and to give them technology to improve people's lifes, apple had vision, tim cook did it until 2018, then everything has go slowly downhill, not all of it of course, but very down, not only that, but jobs said that according to our efforts we decide the price of our products, we try the most to price it correctly, well that was in 2009, and for your knowledge, apple intelligence is only available for 2 iphones (of more than 24 iphones eligible for the ios 18 update *oh is because they don't have 6gb of ram, well darling the Android phone of my Granny costs 200 dollars and has 8gb of ddr4 ram and on screen ai analysis to summarize websites with Gemini for free -well you exchange your data even when they say no but i don't believe any company in terms of 100% privacy so it's meh for me, is logic, that's why USA gov wants to ban TikTok cuz they don't have control over their info and the excuse is that they are \"spies\"-, apple does not use a \"unique physical ram\" to justify their price, like i say.. thefts*) but hey you have good animations :D and \"the ecosystem\" that windows and android are reaching more fast than ever to the point of apple, apple= no moral and respectful for people's money and time (so contrary to Steve's apple), yeah they have good and incredible things like the integration of apple intelligence offline but it doesn't help the fact that whenever they do something great they put it like god's new technology to justify prices in this times when they are not the unique smartphone company they were in 2007-2018, others are in the same level or little lower or little higher than them in terms of technology, i hope that the apple directive is changed but that will not happen because money runs the world and if they are still selling, nothing will change.  P.d. They said thar A17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really? They always said new processors of apple silicon are the most fastest in the world all the time, the processor of the iphone 14 pro max is slow? Gosh they are really inmoral capitalists (i agree with capitalism and liberal economies)   \n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Summarized by AskTube WWDC Keynote Highlights 📱 00:02 Apple's WWDC keynote was filled with exciting announcements, including a surprise introduction to AI in the second half. 00:25 The author live-tweeted the event and summarizes all the key announcements and thoughts.

Others spend time babbling and trying to be funny and you sound like a tech guy giving us tech news. I have a suggestion to take you to a new level. I have been writing Apple for years. I honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. I’ll share them in a moment. By the way I am a software engineer. I am not one who thinks I am so D smart or the smarted person in the room. I love to always learn and ai find I am always learning new things from you. So my idea for you is a real tech news Channel. This will make you something like the Wal Mart of tech news. This idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. I tried to float this to Apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. We have CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iPhone is released. Tech news is happening every day all day. I say join forces with some of the best like yourself, Brian Tong, possibly some from Engadget and create a real Tech News channel. It’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. EVs and Republicans wanting to K EVs, TicTok, Twitter. With social media companies being as influential as they have become. They’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. A real tech news channel will do this. What you and others do is journalism. I want the news to still be fun but I want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a CNN. You will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech CEO’s. It’s a militia billion. Dollar idea I am giving to you. This is something new of its kind and needed. Tech is no longer just mobile. We have stepped into the world of AI and Humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will I pack them. I would love to work with you as a producer or something. I have a huge idea and it will work.   \n5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I will never understand these chucklefucks trying to sell VR as a productivity tool at this stage in its development. Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face. ==================================== My requirements for a phone are actually quite simple:  -a camera with acceptable image quality -no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display -stereo front-facing speakers -a headphone jack as backup for when I need it -expandable storage for when I need it -the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS Thus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone. ==================================== Okay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see. ==================================== I honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet. ==================================== I'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.   \n6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            My first impression is definitely that they’re playing catch-up, in terms of QoL features. They could’ve done this back in iOS 14 at once, there’s no reason to take 4 years to incorporate all these features. Summarization was already available on Mac, I’ve sent numerous feature requests, asking them to bring it system-wide to iPads and iPhones. This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray. I predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that.  The only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”.  This isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability.  Last time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected.  Furthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac.  - why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing?  Another thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got: - better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago) - Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind.  A few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.   \n7  Tim Cook is shouting from the roof, Craig and the exec team skydiving, Mike Rockwell in a Vision Pro, Apple video team budget at an all time high.

Hats off to the developers working crazy hours to make the features announced a reality.   \n8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           **Lots** of great updates. There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance: 1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri. 2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap. 3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat. 4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.   5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.) 6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.) I get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.   \n9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               My takeaway was that across MacOS, iOS and iPadOS I found very few things that I could tell I would include in my daily use. I already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions.  I could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter! I just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro.  This came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\" I already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup.  Apple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels. Softwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works. So, I'm out, except for Mac.   \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          condensed_text  \n0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            We're all sinners who've committed at least one sin, earning eternal punishment in Hell. God sent Jesus as a perfect sacrifice to take on our sins, shedding his blood on the cross. Jesus rose from the dead on the 3rd day and ascended to Heaven, showing life after death. John 14:6 says Jesus is the only way to the Father, and Romans 10:13 states that whoever calls on the Lord will be saved. Eternal life in Heaven is just one prayer away. Believe that Jesus died on the cross for your sins and rose from the dead. Ask Jesus to save you from your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Don't let pride lead you to eternal punishment in Hell. Satan wants to resist the truth and keep you from being saved. Hell is a place of everlasting torture with no relief. I'm sharing this message to wake people up and encourage them to ask Jesus into their hearts. Distractions in life can lead people astray from thinking about salvation and life after death. Ask Jesus to save you from your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. He will save you from eternal damnation in Hell and give you a place in Heaven.  \n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The new iPad calculator app is just a gimmick. It's being hailed for its ability to give answers as you write down a math question, but this feature is only useful up to 4th grade. Math exams require showing work and doing mental arithmetic, making a physical calculator much more practical. The app's AI-powered features are no match for dedicated calculators that can solve integrals, graph functions, and more. In fact, the TI-Nspire calculator is a better and more powerful tool for advanced math. The app's novelty and design make it appealing, but it can't replace the functionality of a physical calculator.\\n\\nThe app's other features, such as adjusting numbers for new answers and adding graphs, can be replicated with existing software like Geogebra and Desmos. These free and more powerful alternatives make the iPad calculator app seem like a waste of money. It's all about prioritizing real-world usefulness over engineering complexity and marketing hype.  \n2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Apple's recent presentation said iPhone 15 Pro models will have Apple Intelligence, excluding many others. I find it surprising, as Steve Jobs said Apple is for humanity and should make technology accessible. According to Jobs, Apple sets prices based on their efforts, but it seems they're prioritizing profits over people.\\n\\nThe only Apple Intelligence-enabled iPhones are the 15 Pro models, priced at over $1,100 and $1,300. Meanwhile, there are Android phones with similar capabilities available for $200, like my grandma's phone. I'm skeptical about 6GB of RAM being the sole reason for this limitation.\\n\\nApple's lack of transparency and control over data is another issue. They claim their unique physical RAM justifies their prices, but it's just an excuse. I think their focus on profits over people's money and time is a significant departure from Steve Jobs' vision.\\n\\nThe good animations and ecosystem are nice, but they don't make up for the price discrepancy. Apple's integration of Apple Intelligence offline is impressive, but it's overshadowed by their greedy pricing strategy.\\n\\nThe company's Director may need a change of heart, but I doubt it, as money often drives decisions.  \n3  At WWDC, Apple made several exciting announcements, including a surprise introduction to AI. Vision OS 2.0 features new wrist-turn gestures and quick access to the control center. iOS got an update with customizable home screens and a new theme engine. Other updates include Mac mirroring with higher resolution, new tools for spatial videos, and scheduling text messages.\\n\\nAirPods and Apple TV got minor updates, while iPad OS allows remote control of someone's iPad and features an impressive calculator app. Mac OS got a new version, Sequoia, with automatic window snapping and a new password app. Apple rebranded AI as Apple Intelligence, featuring new generative models and large language models. Apple Intelligence includes writing tools, a cleanup tool, and generative emojis.\\n\\nApple handles AI tasks on-device, using Apple-built models for faster processing. For complex tasks, Apple has alternative approaches, including a server-based model on Apple's Private Cloud compute or user permission to use ChatGPT. Apple ensures privacy and security by not storing requests, obscuring IP addresses, and preventing OpenAI from forming profiles. I believe Apple's AI features are superior due to personalization and existing user info. The AI announcements are a new age for Apple and I'm excited to explore its capabilities. I'll create more videos about Apple's AI features and encourage viewers to subscribe for updates.  \n4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I want to thank you for creating well-thought-out tech news videos. As a software engineer, I appreciate your technical expertise. I have a suggestion to take your content to the next level: creating a 24/7 tech news channel. This would be a game-changer in the tech space and could put some influencers out of business. Currently, there are only limited tech news segments on mainstream news channels. With a dedicated tech news channel, you could create in-depth interviews and features, similar to what you do now with tech CEOs. This would provide a comprehensive source of tech news and analysis. I've had ideas and concepts that I've shared with Apple, who didn't seem interested. I'd love to collaborate with you on this idea and bring a team of experts together to create a high-quality tech news channel. I believe this concept has the potential to be a billion-dollar idea. I'm a lifelong learner and enjoy learning from your content. I'd be happy to work with you as a producer or in any capacity.  \n5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I'm skeptical about selling VR headsets as productivity tools, especially given their current bulkiness and discomfort. It's too early to try to make VR a normal work tool.\\n\\nMy phone requirements are simple: good camera, no notches, stereo speakers, headphone jack, expandable storage, and a customizable home screen like Palm's WebOS. Unfortunately, few devices fit these criteria, and none are iPhones.\\n\\nI do appreciate some apps, like the new iPad OS calculator app, which uses OCR and AI well. However, I'm not impressed with most AI-powered features, as they often struggle with language and image processing.\\n\\nI'd love to see AI used to optimize camera settings and take better photos. Faster sensors could help adjust settings and merge images like the Light camera. This feature would be awesome and currently unmatched.\\n\\nI'm disappointed Apple didn't announce updated high-end Mac products, leaving no official news on the M3 or M4 Ultra chip or next-gen Mac Pro. Content creators reliant on Macs should be impatient for these updates.  \n6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          My initial impression is that Apple is catching up on quality of life features. They could have implemented them years ago, especially summarization, which was already available on Mac. I've asked for this feature to be system-wide on iPads and iPhones. Other features, like increased Tapback options, are exciting but similar to those found in other apps. Google Photos and Amazon already had some of these features.\\n\\nI predict that within five years, the iPad will become more powerful, and the Files app will be reformed. The only original features I saw at WWDC were image and emoji generation, which felt like mockups with twists. I'm not criticizing Apple for adopting these features, but I miss the days of feature-packed updates on Mac.\\n\\nThe iPad has become more buggy, and I feel like it's being neglected. Many features can be replicated on the iPhone or Mac, making me question why I should pay $1000 for the iPad Pro when the $300 iPad does the same thing. I'm also disappointed that features from Mac, like better app organization, weren't brought to the iPad earlier. Quinn from Snazzy Labs highlighted this issue perfectly, pointing out Apple's failure to address iPad problems.  \n7                                                                                                                 Apple had a huge WWDC, with many exciting features across their platforms. VisionOS 2 introduces 2k native apps, 1.5m compatible apps, and impressive photography features. iOS 18 brings a new Home Screen, customizable widgets, and improved Control Center. Other features include a rearranged Home Screen, mouse support, and new APIs. The Photos app has been redesigned, and Mail has added on-device categorization and AI-powered email summaries.\\n\\nOn the Applewatch side, watchOS 11 introduces a new Training Mode, fitness tracking enhancements, and improved vitals tracking. tvOS gets Insight in video to identify actors and music, and spatial audio. iPadOS 18 brings Shareplay, a redesigned app bar, and a calculator app. macOS Sequoia adds iPhone mirroring, tiling and snapping, and a new Passwords app. The Safari browser gets Highlights, summaries, and picture-in-picture mode.\\n\\nApple Intelligence, a new AI platform, is being integrated across the system, offering features like writing tools, proofreading, and summarization. Siri gets improved language understanding, type-to-Siri, and on-screen awareness. Finally, ChatGPT 4o is a new AI-powered chatbot that can answer general knowledge questions and generate complex images. Overall, it was a jam-packed WWDC with many exciting features and integrations.  \n8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I'm excited about the recent updates, but there are a few features that didn't initially win me over. I'm not a fan of Microsoft's generative features being integrated into their software, and I don't think I'll use them here. I prefer Apple's Siri features, which I think are more essential for me.\\n\\nI also didn't like the color-tinted icons, which remind me of cheap third-party icon packs. It feels like a stopgap measure to appease users who want custom icon support.\\n\\nThe new Passwords app is useful for many users, but I already use Bitwarden and hope Apple doesn't try to push their own solution.\\n\\nThe integration of ChatGPT branding into the user experience feels un-Apple like to me. I'm also glad to see window snapping added to Mac OS, but I miss my old Swish + Alt-Tab setup.\\n\\nThe Settings app has become so complicated that even Apple's AI-powered navigation feature feels like a necessary solution. As a software engineer and consumer, I'm always a little uncomfortable with feature bloat, but I'm excited to try out the new release.  \n9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I was underwhelmed by the latest iOS, iPadOS, and MacOS updates. I didn't find any features that I would use daily, except for maybe improved virtual desktop handling. I already use 1Password, so Apple Passwords wasn't an improvement for me. I prefer BetterTouchTool's snap functions for corner splits. I recently traded in my 2017 iPad Pro for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ at a lower cost. The S9+'s 16:10 format isn't ideal, but it's more compact than my old iPad Pro. Apple announced that my iPad Pro wouldn't get iOS 18, which wasn't a surprise given the lack of exciting features. I already use a Samsung Fold 4, which I love despite its unreliability. Apple's lack of innovative features is a dilemma, making it hard to upgrade since I'm not missing out on much. The price hike for newer phones and tablets means I can easily keep using older devices without feeling like I'm missing out. Samsung's OneUI offers more customization options, making it feel more tailored to my preferences. Additionally, I appreciate the fine-tuned toggles that allow me to alter the features to my liking.

I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness.

MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world. Ok, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks: It’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. You can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly. It can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want. You can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers. The features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools? The first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic.  In this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer. Anything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire   That calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad. The second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons? Finally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all. You don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype. This reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing). It’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives. Other examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.</td>\n      <td>The new iPad calculator app is just a gimmick. It's being hailed for its ability to give answers as you write down a math question, but this feature is only useful up to 4th grade. Math exams require showing work and doing mental arithmetic, making a physical calculator much more practical. The app's AI-powered features are no match for dedicated calculators that can solve integrals, graph functions, and more. In fact, the TI-Nspire calculator is a better and more powerful tool for advanced math. The app's novelty and design make it appealing, but it can't replace the functionality of a physical calculator.\\n\\nThe app's other features, such as adjusting numbers for new answers and adding graphs, can be replicated with existing software like Geogebra and Desmos. These free and more powerful alternatives make the iPad calculator app seem like a waste of money. It's all about prioritizing real-world usefulness over engineering complexity and marketing hype.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>Not only that, for most of the presentation they did say that iphone would have apple intelligence and in the end they said only iphone 15 pro models, is like... 😂 okay apple, not all people can afford a 1100 and 1300 dollars usd smartphones, thanks, steve jobs said that apple is for the humanity and to give them technology to improve people's lifes, apple had vision, tim cook did it until 2018, then everything has go slowly downhill, not all of it of course, but very down, not only that, but jobs said that according to our efforts we decide the price of our products, we try the most to price it correctly, well that was in 2009, and for your knowledge, apple intelligence is only available for 2 iphones (of more than 24 iphones eligible for the ios 18 update *oh is because they don't have 6gb of ram, well darling the Android phone of my Granny costs 200 dollars and has 8gb of ddr4 ram and on screen ai analysis to summarize websites with Gemini for free -well you exchange your data even when they say no but i don't believe any company in terms of 100% privacy so it's meh for me, is logic, that's why USA gov wants to ban TikTok cuz they don't have control over their info and the excuse is that they are \"spies\"-, apple does not use a \"unique physical ram\" to justify their price, like i say.. thefts*) but hey you have good animations :D and \"the ecosystem\" that windows and android are reaching more fast than ever to the point of apple, apple= no moral and respectful for people's money and time (so contrary to Steve's apple), yeah they have good and incredible things like the integration of apple intelligence offline but it doesn't help the fact that whenever they do something great they put it like god's new technology to justify prices in this times when they are not the unique smartphone company they were in 2007-2018, others are in the same level or little lower or little higher than them in terms of technology, i hope that the apple directive is changed but that will not happen because money runs the world and if they are still selling, nothing will change.  P.d. They said thar A17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really? They always said new processors of apple silicon are the most fastest in the world all the time, the processor of the iphone 14 pro max is slow? Gosh they are really inmoral capitalists (i agree with capitalism and liberal economies)</td>\n      <td>Apple's recent presentation said iPhone 15 Pro models will have Apple Intelligence, excluding many others. I find it surprising, as Steve Jobs said Apple is for humanity and should make technology accessible. According to Jobs, Apple sets prices based on their efforts, but it seems they're prioritizing profits over people.\\n\\nThe only Apple Intelligence-enabled iPhones are the 15 Pro models, priced at over $1,100 and $1,300. Meanwhile, there are Android phones with similar capabilities available for $200, like my grandma's phone. I'm skeptical about 6GB of RAM being the sole reason for this limitation.\\n\\nApple's lack of transparency and control over data is another issue. They claim their unique physical RAM justifies their prices, but it's just an excuse. I think their focus on profits over people's money and time is a significant departure from Steve Jobs' vision.\\n\\nThe good animations and ecosystem are nice, but they don't make up for the price discrepancy. Apple's integration of Apple Intelligence offline is impressive, but it's overshadowed by their greedy pricing strategy.\\n\\nThe company's Director may need a change of heart, but I doubt it, as money often drives decisions.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>Summarized by AskTube WWDC Keynote Highlights 📱 00:02 Apple's WWDC keynote was filled with exciting announcements, including a surprise introduction to AI in the second half. 00:25 The author live-tweeted the event and summarizes all the key announcements and thoughts.

I believe Apple's AI features are superior due to personalization and existing user info. The AI announcements are a new age for Apple and I'm excited to explore its capabilities. I'll create more videos about Apple's AI features and encourage viewers to subscribe for updates.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>I want to thank you for always giving us a well thought videos. Others spend time babbling and trying to be funny and you sound like a tech guy giving us tech news. I have a suggestion to take you to a new level. I have been writing Apple for years. I honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. I’ll share them in a moment. By the way I am a software engineer. I am not one who thinks I am so D smart or the smarted person in the room. I love to always learn and ai find I am always learning new things from you. So my idea for you is a real tech news Channel. This will make you something like the Wal Mart of tech news. This idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. I tried to float this to Apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. We have CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iPhone is released. Tech news is happening every day all day. I say join forces with some of the best like yourself, Brian Tong, possibly some from Engadget and create a real Tech News channel. It’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. EVs and Republicans wanting to K EVs, TicTok, Twitter. With social media companies being as influential as they have become. They’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. A real tech news channel will do this. What you and others do is journalism. I want the news to still be fun but I want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a CNN. You will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech CEO’s. It’s a militia billion. Dollar idea I am giving to you. This is something new of its kind and needed. Tech is no longer just mobile. We have stepped into the world of AI and Humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will I pack them. I would love to work with you as a producer or something. I have a huge idea and it will work.</td>\n      <td>I want to thank you for creating well-thought-out tech news videos. As a software engineer, I appreciate your technical expertise. I have a suggestion to take your content to the next level: creating a 24/7 tech news channel. This would be a game-changer in the tech space and could put some influencers out of business. Currently, there are only limited tech news segments on mainstream news channels. With a dedicated tech news channel, you could create in-depth interviews and features, similar to what you do now with tech CEOs. This would provide a comprehensive source of tech news and analysis. I've had ideas and concepts that I've shared with Apple, who didn't seem interested. I'd love to collaborate with you on this idea and bring a team of experts together to create a high-quality tech news channel. I believe this concept has the potential to be a billion-dollar idea. I'm a lifelong learner and enjoy learning from your content. I'd be happy to work with you as a producer or in any capacity.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>5</th>\n      <td>I will never understand these chucklefucks trying to sell VR as a productivity tool at this stage in its development. Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face. ==================================== My requirements for a phone are actually quite simple:  -a camera with acceptable image quality -no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display -stereo front-facing speakers -a headphone jack as backup for when I need it -expandable storage for when I need it -the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS Thus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone. ==================================== Okay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see. ==================================== I honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet. ==================================== I'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.</td>\n      <td>I'm skeptical about selling VR headsets as productivity tools, especially given their current bulkiness and discomfort. It's too early to try to make VR a normal work tool.\\n\\nMy phone requirements are simple: good camera, no notches, stereo speakers, headphone jack, expandable storage, and a customizable home screen like Palm's WebOS. Unfortunately, few devices fit these criteria, and none are iPhones.\\n\\nI do appreciate some apps, like the new iPad OS calculator app, which uses OCR and AI well. However, I'm not impressed with most AI-powered features, as they often struggle with language and image processing.\\n\\nI'd love to see AI used to optimize camera settings and take better photos. Faster sensors could help adjust settings and merge images like the Light camera.

They could’ve done this back in iOS 14 at once, there’s no reason to take 4 years to incorporate all these features. Summarization was already available on Mac, I’ve sent numerous feature requests, asking them to bring it system-wide to iPads and iPhones. This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray. I predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that.  The only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”.  This isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability.  Last time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected.  Furthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac.  - why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing?  Another thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got: - better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago) - Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind.  A few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.</td>\n      <td>My initial impression is that Apple is catching up on quality of life features. They could have implemented them years ago, especially summarization, which was already available on Mac. I've asked for this feature to be system-wide on iPads and iPhones.

There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance: 1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri. 2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap. 3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat. 4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.   5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.) 6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.) I get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.</td>\n      <td>I'm excited about the recent updates, but there are a few features that didn't initially win me over. I'm not a fan of Microsoft's generative features being integrated into their software, and I don't think I'll use them here. I prefer Apple's Siri features, which I think are more essential for me.\\n\\nI also didn't like the color-tinted icons, which remind me of cheap third-party icon packs. It feels like a stopgap measure to appease users who want custom icon support.\\n\\nThe new Passwords app is useful for many users, but I already use Bitwarden and hope Apple doesn't try to push their own solution.\\n\\nThe integration of ChatGPT branding into the user experience feels un-Apple like to me. I'm also glad to see window snapping added to Mac OS, but I miss my old Swish + Alt-Tab setup.\\n\\nThe Settings app has become so complicated that even Apple's AI-powered navigation feature feels like a necessary solution.

I already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions.  I could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter! I just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro.  This came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\" I already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup.  Apple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels. Softwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works. So, I'm out, except for Mac.</td>\n      <td>I was underwhelmed by the latest iOS, iPadOS, and MacOS updates. I didn't find any features that I would use daily, except for maybe improved virtual desktop handling. I already use 1Password, so Apple Passwords wasn't an improvement for me. I prefer BetterTouchTool's snap functions for corner splits. I recently traded in my 2017 iPad Pro for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ at a lower cost. The S9+'s 16:10 format isn't ideal, but it's more compact than my old iPad Pro. Apple announced that my iPad Pro wouldn't get iOS 18, which wasn't a surprise given the lack of exciting features. I already use a Samsung Fold 4, which I love despite its unreliability. Apple's lack of innovative features is a dilemma, making it hard to upgrade since I'm not missing out on much. The price hike for newer phones and tablets means I can easily keep using older devices without feeling like I'm missing out. Samsung's OneUI offers more customization options, making it feel more tailored to my preferences.

If they just plug into the existing extensibility model, and this new app is treated the same as a third-party option, then I’m happy.   \n5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Romans 3:23 states: \"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;\". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 \"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\". Romans 10:13 states \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\". \\r\\n\\r\\n   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.   \n6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   My take on WWDC's iPad calculator app: It's nothing more than a gimmick\\n\\nWWDC just dropped yesterday and one of the highlight features was the calculator app feature. MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world.\\n\\nOk, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks:\\n\\nIt’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question.\\n\\nYou can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly.\\n\\nIt can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want.\\n\\nYou can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers.\\n\\nThe features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools?\\n\\nThe first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic. \\n\\nIn this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer.\\n\\nAnything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire \\n\\n\\nThat calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad.\\n\\nThe second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons?\\n\\nFinally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all.\\n\\nYou don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype.\\n\\nThis reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing).\\n\\nIt’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives.\\n\\nOther examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.   \n7

did say that iphone would have apple intelligence and in the end they said only iphone 15 pro models, is like... 😂 okay apple, not all people can afford a 1100 and 1300 dollars usd smartphones, thanks, steve jobs said that apple is for the humanity and to give them technology to improve people's lifes, apple had vision, tim cook did it until 2018, then everything has go slowly downhill, not all of it of course, but very down, not only that, but jobs said that according to our efforts we decide the price of our products, we try the most to price it correctly, well that was in 2009, and for your knowledge, apple intelligence is only available for 2 iphones (of more than 24 iphones eligible for the ios 18 update *oh is because they don't have 6gb of ram, well darling the Android phone of my Granny costs 200 dollars and has 8gb of ddr4 ram and on screen ai analysis to summarize websites with Gemini for free -well you exchange your data even when they say no but i don't believe any company in terms of 100% privacy so it's meh for me, is logic, that's why USA gov wants to ban TikTok cuz they don't have control over their info and the excuse is that they are \"spies\"-, apple does not use a \"unique physical ram\" to justify their price, like i say.. thefts*) but hey you have good animations :D and \"the ecosystem\" that windows and android are reaching more fast than ever to the point of apple, apple= no moral and respectful for people's money and time (so contrary to Steve's apple), yeah they have good and incredible things like the integration of apple intelligence offline but it doesn't help the fact that whenever they do something great they put it like god's new technology to justify prices in this times when they are not the unique smartphone company they were in 2007-2018, others are in the same level or little lower or little higher than them in terms of technology, i hope that the apple directive is changed but that will not happen because money runs the world and if they are still selling, nothing will change. \\n\\nP.d. They said thar A17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really? They always said new processors of apple silicon are the most fastest in the world all the time, the processor of the iphone 14 pro max is slow? Gosh they are really inmoral capitalists (i agree with capitalism and liberal economies)   \n8

                                                         I want to thank you for always giving us a well thought videos. Others spend time babbling and trying to be funny and you sound like a tech guy giving us tech news. I have a suggestion to take you to a new level. I have been writing Apple for years. I honestly believe they have used some of my ideas. I’ll share them in a moment. By the way I am a software engineer. I am not one who thinks I am so D smart or the smarted person in the room. I love to always learn and ai find I am always learning new things from you. So my idea for you is a real tech news Channel. This will make you something like the Wal Mart of tech news. This idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. I tried to float this to Apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. We have CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iPhone is released. Tech news is happening every day all day. I say join forces with some of the best like yourself, Brian Tong, possibly some from Engadget and create a real Tech News channel. It’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. EVs and Republicans wanting to K EVs, TicTok, Twitter. With social media companies being as influential as they have become. They’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. A real tech news channel will do this. What you and others do is journalism. I want the news to still be fun but I want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a CNN. You will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech CEO’s. It’s a militia billion. Dollar idea I am giving to you. This is something new of its kind and needed. Tech is no longer just mobile. We have stepped into the world of AI and Humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will I pack them. I would love to work with you as a producer or something. I have a huge idea and it will work.   \n10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I will never understand these chucklefucks trying to sell VR as a productivity tool at this stage in its development. Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face.\\n====================================\\nMy requirements for a phone are actually quite simple: \\n-a camera with acceptable image quality\\n-no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display\\n-stereo front-facing speakers\\n-a headphone jack as backup for when I need it\\n-expandable storage for when I need it\\n-the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS\\n\\nThus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone.\\n====================================\\nOkay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see.\\n====================================\\nI honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet.\\n====================================\\nI'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.   \n11

                                                                                                                                                            My first impression is definitely that they’re playing catch-up, in terms of QoL features.\\n\\nThey could’ve done this back in iOS 14 at once, there’s no reason to take 4 years to incorporate all these features.\\n\\nSummarization was already available on Mac, I’ve sent numerous feature requests, asking them to bring it system-wide to iPads and iPhones. This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray.\\n\\nI predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that. \\n\\nThe only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”. \\n\\nThis isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability. \\nLast time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected. \\nFurthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac. \\n- why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing? \\nAnother thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got:\\n- better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago)\\n- Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind. \\n\\nA few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.   \n12  Tim Cook is shouting from the roof, Craig and the exec team skydiving, Mike Rockwell in a Vision Pro, Apple video team budget at an all time high.

What a day, this was probably the most jam packed WWDC I have watched in a long time. They definitely went deeper on integration that I thought they would.

There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance:\\n\\n1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri.\\n2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap.\\n3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat.\\n4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.  \\n5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.)\\n6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.)\\n\\nI get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.   \n14                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              My takeaway was that across MacOS, iOS and iPadOS I found very few things that I could tell I would include in my daily use.\\n\\nI already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions. \\n\\nI could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter!\\n\\nI just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro. \\n\\nThis came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\"\\n\\nI already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup. \\n\\nApple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels.\\n\\nSoftwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works.\\n\\nSo, I'm out, except for Mac.   \n\n   published_at_date      app  \\\n0         2024-06-11  YouTube   \n1         2024-06-10   Reddit   \n2         2024-06-10   Reddit   \n3         2024-06-10   Reddit   \n4         2024-06-11   Reddit   \n5         2024-06-20  YouTube   \n6         2024-06-13  YouTube   \n7         2024-06-12  YouTube   \n8         2024-06-11  YouTube   \n9         2024-06-11  YouTube   \n10        2024-06-11  YouTube   \n11        2024-06-10  YouTube   \n12        2024-06-10   Reddit   \n13        2024-06-10   Reddit   \n14        2024-06-12   Reddit   \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         final_text  \n0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Kids are going to love Math notes.  \n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Yeah any other year and this would have been a headline feature.

I use Bitwarden. If they just plug into the existing extensibility model, and this new app is treated the same as a third-party option, then I’m happy.  \n5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       We're all sinners who've committed at least one sin, earning eternal punishment in Hell. God sent Jesus as a perfect sacrifice to take on our sins, shedding his blood on the cross. Jesus rose from the dead on the 3rd day and ascended to Heaven, showing life after death. John 14:6 says Jesus is the only way to the Father, and Romans 10:13 states that whoever calls on the Lord will be saved. Eternal life in Heaven is just one prayer away. Believe that Jesus died on the cross for your sins and rose from the dead. Ask Jesus to save you from your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Don't let pride lead you to eternal punishment in Hell. Satan wants to resist the truth and keep you from being saved. Hell is a place of everlasting torture with no relief. I'm sharing this message to wake people up and encourage them to ask Jesus into their hearts. Distractions in life can lead people astray from thinking about salvation and life after death. Ask Jesus to save you from your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. He will save you from eternal damnation in Hell and give you a place in Heaven.  \n6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The new iPad calculator app is just a gimmick. It's being hailed for its ability to give answers as you write down a math question, but this feature is only useful up to 4th grade. Math exams require showing work and doing mental arithmetic, making a physical calculator much more practical. The app's AI-powered features are no match for dedicated calculators that can solve integrals, graph functions, and more. In fact, the TI-Nspire calculator is a better and more powerful tool for advanced math. The app's novelty and design make it appealing, but it can't replace the functionality of a physical calculator. The app's other features, such as adjusting numbers for new answers and adding graphs, can be replicated with existing software like Geogebra and Desmos. These free and more powerful alternatives make the iPad calculator app seem like a waste of money. It's all about prioritizing real-world usefulness over engineering complexity and marketing hype.  \n7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Apple's recent presentation said iPhone 15 Pro models will have Apple Intelligence, excluding many others. I find it surprising, as Steve Jobs said Apple is for humanity and should make technology accessible. According to Jobs, Apple sets prices based on their efforts, but it seems they're prioritizing profits over people. The only Apple Intelligence-enabled iPhones are the 15 Pro models, priced at over $1,100 and $1,300. Meanwhile, there are Android phones with similar capabilities available for $200, like my grandma's phone. I'm skeptical about 6GB of RAM being the sole reason for this limitation. Apple's lack of transparency and control over data is another issue. They claim their unique physical RAM justifies their prices, but it's just an excuse. I think their focus on profits over people's money and time is a significant departure from Steve Jobs' vision. The good animations and ecosystem are nice, but they don't make up for the price discrepancy. Apple's integration of Apple Intelligence offline is impressive, but it's overshadowed by their greedy pricing strategy. The company's Director may need a change of heart, but I doubt it, as money often drives decisions.  \n8   At WWDC, Apple made several exciting announcements, including a surprise introduction to AI. Vision OS 2.0 features new wrist-turn gestures and quick access to the control center. iOS got an update with customizable home screens and a new theme engine. Other updates include Mac mirroring with higher resolution, new tools for spatial videos, and scheduling text messages. AirPods and Apple TV got minor updates, while iPad OS allows remote control of someone's iPad and features an impressive calculator app. Mac OS got a new version, Sequoia, with automatic window snapping and a new password app. Apple rebranded AI as Apple Intelligence, featuring new generative models and large language models. Apple Intelligence includes writing tools, a cleanup tool, and generative emojis. Apple handles AI tasks on-device, using Apple-built models for faster processing. For complex tasks, Apple has alternative approaches, including a server-based model on Apple's Private Cloud compute or user permission to use ChatGPT. Apple ensures privacy and security by not storing requests, obscuring IP addresses, and preventing OpenAI from forming profiles. I believe Apple's AI features are superior due to personalization and existing user info. The AI announcements are a new age for Apple and I'm excited to explore its capabilities. I'll create more videos about Apple's AI features and encourage viewers to subscribe for updates.  \n9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I want to thank you for creating well-thought-out tech news videos. As a software engineer, I appreciate your technical expertise. I have a suggestion to take your content to the next level: creating a 24/7 tech news channel. This would be a game-changer in the tech space and could put some influencers out of business. Currently, there are only limited tech news segments on mainstream news channels. With a dedicated tech news channel, you could create in-depth interviews and features, similar to what you do now with tech CEOs. This would provide a comprehensive source of tech news and analysis. I've had ideas and concepts that I've shared with Apple, who didn't seem interested. I'd love to collaborate with you on this idea and bring a team of experts together to create a high-quality tech news channel. I believe this concept has the potential to be a billion-dollar idea. I'm a lifelong learner and enjoy learning from your content. I'd be happy to work with you as a producer or in any capacity.  \n10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I'm skeptical about selling VR headsets as productivity tools, especially given their current bulkiness and discomfort. It's too early to try to make VR a normal work tool. My phone requirements are simple: good camera, no notches, stereo speakers, headphone jack, expandable storage, and a customizable home screen like Palm's WebOS. Unfortunately, few devices fit these criteria, and none are iPhones. I do appreciate some apps, like the new iPad OS calculator app, which uses OCR and AI well. However, I'm not impressed with most AI-powered features, as they often struggle with language and image processing. I'd love to see AI used to optimize camera settings and take better photos. Faster sensors could help adjust settings and merge images like the Light camera. This feature would be awesome and currently unmatched. I'm disappointed Apple didn't announce updated high-end Mac products, leaving no official news on the M3 or M4 Ultra chip or next-gen Mac Pro. Content creators reliant on Macs should be impatient for these updates.  \n11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          My initial impression is that Apple is catching up on quality of life features. They could have implemented them years ago, especially summarization, which was already available on Mac. I've asked for this feature to be system-wide on iPads and iPhones. Other features, like increased Tapback options, are exciting but similar to those found in other apps. Google Photos and Amazon already had some of these features. I predict that within five years, the iPad will become more powerful, and the Files app will be reformed. The only original features I saw at WWDC were image and emoji generation, which felt like mockups with twists. I'm not criticizing Apple for adopting these features, but I miss the days of feature-packed updates on Mac. The iPad has become more buggy, and I feel like it's being neglected. Many features can be replicated on the iPhone or Mac, making me question why I should pay $1000 for the iPad Pro when the $300 iPad does the same thing. I'm also disappointed that features from Mac, like better app organization, weren't brought to the iPad earlier. Quinn from Snazzy Labs highlighted this issue perfectly, pointing out Apple's failure to address iPad problems.  \n12                                                                                                                 Apple had a huge WWDC, with many exciting features across their platforms. VisionOS 2 introduces 2k native apps, 1.5m compatible apps, and impressive photography features. iOS 18 brings a new Home Screen, customizable widgets, and improved Control Center. Other features include a rearranged Home Screen, mouse support, and new APIs. The Photos app has been redesigned, and Mail has added on-device categorization and AI-powered email summaries. On the Applewatch side, watchOS 11 introduces a new Training Mode, fitness tracking enhancements, and improved vitals tracking. tvOS gets Insight in video to identify actors and music, and spatial audio. iPadOS 18 brings Shareplay, a redesigned app bar, and a calculator app. macOS Sequoia adds iPhone mirroring, tiling and snapping, and a new Passwords app. The Safari browser gets Highlights, summaries, and picture-in-picture mode.

Siri gets improved language understanding, type-to-Siri, and on-screen awareness. Finally, ChatGPT 4o is a new AI-powered chatbot that can answer general knowledge questions and generate complex images. Overall, it was a jam-packed WWDC with many exciting features and integrations.  \n13                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I'm excited about the recent updates, but there are a few features that didn't initially win me over. I'm not a fan of Microsoft's generative features being integrated into their software, and I don't think I'll use them here. I prefer Apple's Siri features, which I think are more essential for me. I also didn't like the color-tinted icons, which remind me of cheap third-party icon packs. It feels like a stopgap measure to appease users who want custom icon support. The new Passwords app is useful for many users, but I already use Bitwarden and hope Apple doesn't try to push their own solution. The integration of ChatGPT branding into the user experience feels un-Apple like to me. I'm also glad to see window snapping added to Mac OS, but I miss my old Swish + Alt-Tab setup. The Settings app has become so complicated that even Apple's AI-powered navigation feature feels like a necessary solution. As a software engineer and consumer, I'm always a little uncomfortable with feature bloat, but I'm excited to try out the new release.  \n14                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I was underwhelmed by the latest iOS, iPadOS, and MacOS updates. I didn't find any features that I would use daily, except for maybe improved virtual desktop handling. I already use 1Password, so Apple Passwords wasn't an improvement for me. I prefer BetterTouchTool's snap functions for corner splits. I recently traded in my 2017 iPad Pro for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ at a lower cost. The S9+'s 16:10 format isn't ideal, but it's more compact than my old iPad Pro. Apple announced that my iPad Pro wouldn't get iOS 18, which wasn't a surprise given the lack of exciting features. I already use a Samsung Fold 4, which I love despite its unreliability. Apple's lack of innovative features is a dilemma, making it hard to upgrade since I'm not missing out on much. The price hike for newer phones and tablets means I can easily keep using older devices without feeling like I'm missing out. Samsung's OneUI offers more customization options, making it feel more tailored to my preferences. Additionally, I appreciate the fine-tuned toggles that allow me to alter the features to my liking.

MKBHD, the gold standard reviewer to go to when it comes to technology, called it the only “incredible feature” that came to the iPad. But like almost every other hyped software/AI update these days, they hardly get used by us in the real world.\\n\\nOk, let’s dive into the main Math Notes features that everyone is so excited about and I will explain why they are all useless gimmicks:\\n\\nIt’s able to give you answers as you write down a maths question.\\n\\nYou can adjust the information in your math question and the answer will update accordingly.\\n\\nIt can support variables and equations, and you can manipulate them all you want.\\n\\nYou can add graphs in the notes and demonstrate the function as you manipulate the numbers.\\n\\nThe features listed above are pretty cool, but if we were to put them in a real-world context, they instantly become obsolete and can easily be replaced with better tools and software. What is the real-world context? In this case, Apple is targeting students in classroom settings, right? You are writing down equations, doing maths questions, playing with graphs, variables, functions etc. So how does it compare to classroom tools?\\n\\nThe first feature is being able to give you answers as you write down a maths question. This feature is pretty useless beyond 4th grade. The maths that we do after 4th grade becomes more complex, we need to manipulate equations and find x. It’s not a matter of 89 * 34 =? In maths exams or practices, you need to show your working out and you need to do the mental arithmetic. \\n\\nIn this case, how does the iPad even come in handy? You may argue that, in some cases, you might need to do complex calculations that you cannot do in your head. Yeah right, that’s what the physical calculator that comes with the exams is for. The physical calculator is faster, easier and more representative of what you would face in exams. A physical calculator is just better in every way and form than doing maths on an iPad and hoping that the AI will read your handwriting and then provide an answer.\\n\\nAnything beyond primary school, the feature becomes inferior to a physical calculator. Anything beyond middle school, you would not even bother using the Maths Notes app. There is a reason why we need to buy a 200 dollar calculator for our exams like the TI-Nspire \\n\\n\\nThat calculator simply blows the iPad out of the water in so many ways. The functions on the calculator go beyond solving questions, it can solve integrals, binomial theorem, graph trigonometric functions and show the gradient, the concavity, local max and local min… Simply put, anything beyond primary school, the feature on your iPad can easily be replaced by physical calculators that not only better resemble exam conditions, but they have way more features and are way more powerful than the maths notes feature on the iPad.\\n\\nThe second feature, adjusting numbers and you get new a answer. I don’t even know what’s so worth showing off about this feature. The cool factor that comes from these features is not because of their applications but instead because of their novelty and difficulty in designing something that could easily be done by something else. You can do just the same with the calculator shown above, or even if you have a crappy one, how hard is it for you to retype the numbers using physical buttons?\\n\\nFinally, for the third and fourth features, the graphs and functions. Does Apple not know free amazing software like Geogebra and Desmos exist? They have way more features than the maths notes and are free. They are just better in so many ways that this blog won’t be able to fit it all.\\n\\nYou don’t have to spend 1000 dollars on an iPad to get access to those features. All of the software features that you need for school work are already there on the internet for you. The physical calculator is just as good, if not, better than the iPad calculator when it comes to doing maths. The features on the iPad are a complete gimmick and they are not worth the hype.\\n\\nThis reminds me of the humanoid robots that some companies are designing these days. Sure, they are cool, but suck at what they do. There are robots everywhere around us, but they simply don’t take the shape of humans. There are robots in the manufacturing factories to build cars, make clothes, and seal boxes. These robots are good at what they do. But why do we not find them impressive? Instead, we think that humanoid robots are impressive. The reason does not lie within their real-life applications and how pragmatic they are, the reason is that they are a marvel piece of engineering (that is good at nothing).\\n\\nIt’s easy to mix a product’s usefulness with its engineering complexity with all the marketing on the internet these days. In the future, when we see another new feature or product marketed to us, rather than blindly following the hype, perhaps we should stop and reflect on how this feature would be translated to real-world use. The chances are, they are pretty damn useless and easily replaceable with much cheaper and effective alternatives.\\n\\nOther examples include the Samsung AI features. I got my AI update on my Z fold 4 not long ago and I have rarely used them. I tested the translations and interpretations features and they are all wrong and hardly make any sense. I used the circle to search function maybe twice after all these months of having the feature. Don't forget that the circle to search function was considered a highly useful function by reviewers, but to be honest, none of the circle of people I know use them and they don’t come close to altering the way we interact with our tech by 1%.</td>\n      <td>2024-06-13</td>\n      <td>YouTube</td>\n      <td>The new iPad calculator app is just a gimmick. It's being hailed for its ability to give answers as you write down a math question, but this feature is only useful up to 4th grade. Math exams require showing work and doing mental arithmetic, making a physical calculator much more practical. The app's AI-powered features are no match for dedicated calculators that can solve integrals, graph functions, and more. In fact, the TI-Nspire calculator is a better and more powerful tool for advanced math. The app's novelty and design make it appealing, but it can't replace the functionality of a physical calculator. The app's other features, such as adjusting numbers for new answers and adding graphs, can be replicated with existing software like Geogebra and Desmos. These free and more powerful alternatives make the iPad calculator app seem like a waste of money. It's all about prioritizing real-world usefulness over engineering complexity and marketing hype.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>7</th>\n      <td>@lellmajar</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>Not only that, for most of the presentation they did say that iphone would have apple intelligence and in the end they said only iphone 15 pro models, is like... 😂 okay apple, not all people can afford a 1100 and 1300 dollars usd smartphones, thanks, steve jobs said that apple is for the humanity and to give them technology to improve people's lifes, apple had vision, tim cook did it until 2018, then everything has go slowly downhill, not all of it of course, but very down, not only that, but jobs said that according to our efforts we decide the price of our products, we try the most to price it correctly, well that was in 2009, and for your knowledge, apple intelligence is only available for 2 iphones (of more than 24 iphones eligible for the ios 18 update *oh is because they don't have 6gb of ram, well darling the Android phone of my Granny costs 200 dollars and has 8gb of ddr4 ram and on screen ai analysis to summarize websites with Gemini for free -well you exchange your data even when they say no but i don't believe any company in terms of 100% privacy so it's meh for me, is logic, that's why USA gov wants to ban TikTok cuz they don't have control over their info and the excuse is that they are \"spies\"-, apple does not use a \"unique physical ram\" to justify their price, like i say.. thefts*) but hey you have good animations :D and \"the ecosystem\" that windows and android are reaching more fast than ever to the point of apple, apple= no moral and respectful for people's money and time (so contrary to Steve's apple), yeah they have good and incredible things like the integration of apple intelligence offline but it doesn't help the fact that whenever they do something great they put it like god's new technology to justify prices in this times when they are not the unique smartphone company they were in 2007-2018, others are in the same level or little lower or little higher than them in terms of technology, i hope that the apple directive is changed but that will not happen because money runs the world and if they are still selling, nothing will change. \\n\\nP.d. They said thar A17 pro chipset is the only capable of running apple intelligence , really?

I find it surprising, as Steve Jobs said Apple is for humanity and should make technology accessible. According to Jobs, Apple sets prices based on their efforts, but it seems they're prioritizing profits over people. The only Apple Intelligence-enabled iPhones are the 15 Pro models, priced at over $1,100 and $1,300. Meanwhile, there are Android phones with similar capabilities available for $200, like my grandma's phone. I'm skeptical about 6GB of RAM being the sole reason for this limitation. Apple's lack of transparency and control over data is another issue. They claim their unique physical RAM justifies their prices, but it's just an excuse. I think their focus on profits over people's money and time is a significant departure from Steve Jobs' vision. The good animations and ecosystem are nice, but they don't make up for the price discrepancy. Apple's integration of Apple Intelligence offline is impressive, but it's overshadowed by their greedy pricing strategy. The company's Director may need a change of heart, but I doubt it, as money often drives decisions.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>8</th>\n      <td>@ThuanSuBa</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>Summarized by AskTube\\n\\nWWDC Keynote Highlights 📱\\n00:02 Apple's WWDC keynote was filled with exciting announcements, including a surprise introduction to AI in the second half.\\n\\n00:25 The author live-tweeted the event and summarizes all the key announcements and thoughts.\\n\\nVision OS 2.0 📊\\n00:47 Vision OS 2.0 brings new features like wrist-turn gestures to see time and battery percentage, and quick access to the control center.\\n\\n01:05 New Immersive Media Features: Turn old photos into spatial photos using advanced machine learning, and create spatial videos on non-iPhone cameras.\\n\\niOS Updates 📱\\n02:29 iOS got a major update with customizable home screens, icon placement, and a new theme engine.\\n\\n02:54 Customize your home screen with different colors, and change icon and widget colors to match your wallpaper.\\n\\nOther Updates 📊\\n03:37 Mac mirroring gets a higher resolution, and new tools are available for creating spatial and immersive videos.\\n\\n04:00 New features include scheduling text messages, text formatting, a game mode that minimizes background activity, and automatic categorization in the new mail app.\\n\\nAirPods and Apple TV Updates 🎧\\n06:05 AirPods got minor updates, including voice isolation during phone calls, spatial audio during games, and nodding or shaking for responding to prompts.\\n\\n06:25 Apple TV updates include showing actors' and characters' names on screen and boosting people's voices over the music.\\n\\niPad OS Updates 📊\\n06:41 iPad OS allows remote control of someone's iPad with their permission, perfect for family tech support.\\n\\n07:03 The calculator app on iPad OS is impressive, letting you write equations in handwriting and getting real-time answers.\\n\\nMac OS Updates 📊\\n09:40 Mac OS got a new version called Sequoia, featuring automatic window snapping, built-in backgrounds for webcam feeds, and a new password app.\\n\\nApple Intelligence AI 🤖\\n10:40 Apple rebranded AI as Apple Intelligence, bringing new generative models and large language models to supported devices.\\n\\n11:01 Apple Intelligence features include writing tools, a cleanup tool in Photos, and generative emojis.\\n\\nHow Apple Handles Complex AI Tasks 💻\\n15:10 Apple handles most AI tasks on-device, using Apple-built models for faster processing.

This idea could put some tech influencers out of business with this idea. I tried to float this to Apple but they don’t seem to like the idea. We have CNN, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and from time to time we get tech news but mostly when something new like a new iPhone is released. Tech news is happening every day all day. I say join forces with some of the best like yourself, Brian Tong, possibly some from Engadget and create a real Tech News channel. It’s not based around politics although t today politics and tech seem to collide. EVs and Republicans wanting to K EVs, TicTok, Twitter. With social media companies being as influential as they have become. They’re not on the hot seat enough with cameras in their face or reporters running up on them to ask difficult questions. A real tech news channel will do this. What you and others do is journalism. I want the news to still be fun but I want it just like real news every day 24/7  just like a CNN. You will hire anchors do some in-depth interviews like we see you do often with tech CEO’s. It’s a militia billion. Dollar idea I am giving to you. This is something new of its kind and needed. Tech is no longer just mobile. We have stepped into the world of AI and Humans need to understand how these new pieces of tech will I pack them.

Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face.\\n====================================\\nMy requirements for a phone are actually quite simple: \\n-a camera with acceptable image quality\\n-no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display\\n-stereo front-facing speakers\\n-a headphone jack as backup for when I need it\\n-expandable storage for when I need it\\n-the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS\\n\\nThus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone.\\n====================================\\nOkay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see.\\n====================================\\nI honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet.\\n====================================\\nI'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.</td>\n      <td>2024-06-11</td>\n      <td>YouTube</td>\n      <td>I'm skeptical about selling VR headsets as productivity tools, especially given their current bulkiness and discomfort. It's too early to try to make VR a normal work tool. My phone requirements are simple: good camera, no notches, stereo speakers, headphone jack, expandable storage, and a customizable home screen like Palm's WebOS. Unfortunately, few devices fit these criteria, and none are iPhones. I do appreciate some apps, like the new iPad OS calculator app, which uses OCR and AI well. However, I'm not impressed with most AI-powered features, as they often struggle with language and image processing. I'd love to see AI used to optimize camera settings and take better photos. Faster sensors could help adjust settings and merge images like the Light camera. This feature would be awesome and currently unmatched. I'm disappointed Apple didn't announce updated high-end Mac products, leaving no official news on the M3 or M4 Ultra chip or next-gen Mac Pro. Content creators reliant on Macs should be impatient for these updates.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>11</th>\n      <td>@hilal_younus</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>My first impression is definitely that they’re playing catch-up, in terms of QoL features.\\n\\nThey could’ve done this back in iOS 14 at once, there’s no reason to take 4 years to incorporate all these features.\\n\\nSummarization was already available on Mac, I’ve sent numerous feature requests, asking them to bring it system-wide to iPads and iPhones.

There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance:\\n\\n1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri.\\n2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap.\\n3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat.\\n4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.  \\n5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.)\\n6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.)\\n\\nI get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.</td>\n      <td>2024-06-10</td>\n      <td>Reddit</td>\n      <td>I'm excited about the recent updates, but there are a few features that didn't initially win me over. I'm not a fan of Microsoft's generative features being integrated into their software, and I don't think I'll use them here. I prefer Apple's Siri features, which I think are more essential for me. I also didn't like the color-tinted icons, which remind me of cheap third-party icon packs. It feels like a stopgap measure to appease users who want custom icon support. The new Passwords app is useful for many users, but I already use Bitwarden and hope Apple doesn't try to push their own solution. The integration of ChatGPT branding into the user experience feels un-Apple like to me. I'm also glad to see window snapping added to Mac OS, but I miss my old Swish + Alt-Tab setup. The Settings app has become so complicated that even Apple's AI-powered navigation feature feels like a necessary solution. As a software engineer and consumer, I'm always a little uncomfortable with feature bloat, but I'm excited to try out the new release.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>14</th>\n      <td>kasakka1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>My takeaway was that across MacOS, iOS and iPadOS I found very few things that I could tell I would include in my daily use.\\n\\nI already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions. \\n\\nI could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter!\\n\\nI just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro. \\n\\nThis came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\"\\n\\nI already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup. \\n\\nApple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels.\\n\\nSoftwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works.\\n\\nSo, I'm out, except for Mac.</td>\n      <td>2024-06-12</td>\n      <td>Reddit</td>\n      <td>I was underwhelmed by the latest iOS, iPadOS, and MacOS updates. I didn't find any features that I would use daily, except for maybe improved virtual desktop handling. I already use 1Password, so Apple Passwords wasn't an improvement for me. I prefer BetterTouchTool's snap functions for corner splits. I recently traded in my 2017 iPad Pro for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ at a lower cost. The S9+'s 16:10 format isn't ideal, but it's more compact than my old iPad Pro. Apple announced that my iPad Pro wouldn't get iOS 18, which wasn't a surprise given the lack of exciting features. I already use a Samsung Fold 4, which I love despite its unreliability. Apple's lack of innovative features is a dilemma, making it hard to upgrade since I'm not missing out on much. The price hike for newer phones and tablets means I can easily keep using older devices without feeling like I'm missing out. Samsung's OneUI offers more customization options, making it feel more tailored to my preferences. Additionally, I appreciate the fine-tuned toggles that allow me to alter the features to my liking.</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now let us re-tokenize the text to make sure we don't hit an error.

development. Like, how heavy and cumbersome is Apple Vision or an Oculus headset? Three pounds? Four pounds? Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face.\\n====================================\\nMy requirements for a phone are actually quite simple: \\n-a camera with acceptable image quality\\n-no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display\\n-stereo front-facing speakers\\n-a headphone jack as backup for when I need it\\n-expandable storage for when I need it\\n-the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS\\n\\nThus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone.\\n====================================\\nOkay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see.\\n====================================\\nI honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet.\\n====================================\\nI'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.   \n11645

they’re playing catch-up, in terms of QoL features.\\n\\nThey could’ve done this back in iOS 14 at once, there’s no reason to take 4 years to incorporate all these features.\\n\\nSummarization was already available on Mac, I’ve sent numerous feature requests, asking them to bring it system-wide to iPads and iPhones. This was also the case for increasing options for Tapback in iMessage (like in WhatsApp, and telegram). And, Google photos already does the features which Apple just adopted. And Amazon already has InSight features called X-Ray.\\n\\nI predict that within the next 5 years, we will definitely see iPad becoming more powerful, and hopefully Files app being reformed. This years WWDC just proves that. \\n\\nThe only original features I see is the image and emoji generation, most of them look like Dall-E/ Midjourney mock-ups, with some additional twists like “Sketch”. \\n\\nThis isn’t to criticize Apple for finally adopting these features, but I miss the times when we actually got feature-packed updates for MacOS X. Nowadays, it’s just incremental features with increasing bugs. There were definitely years when Apple wouldn’t have added much features, and instead focused on improving reliability. \\nLast time we got that was in 2018, with iOS 12. Since then, iPads particularly have become more buggier, and have felt like they’re being neglected. \\nFurthermore, there aren’t many new features that are specific to a platform, whatever updates we received on an iPad can most likely be done better on an iPhone or the Mac. \\n- why would I pay $1000 for the iPad Pro When the $300 iPad does the same thing? \\nAnother thing, is the fact that I want to highlight is all the features Macs got:\\n- better app organizing into windows (Windows had this for so many years, and 3rd party apps have brought this to Mac many years ago)\\n- Other features which are ported from the iPhone, it’s obvious that it’s made with iPhone in mind. \\n\\nA few days ago, Quinn from snazzy labs, highlighted this issue in a perfect manner highlighting how Apple failed to address the glaring issues with iPads.   \n11646  Tim Cook is shouting from the roof, Craig and the exec team skydiving, Mike Rockwell in a Vision Pro, Apple video team budget at an all time high.

What a day, this was probably the most jam packed WWDC I have watched in a long time. They definitely went deeper on integration that I thought they would.

There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance:\\n\\n1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri.\\n2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap.\\n3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat.\\n4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.  \\n5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.)\\n6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.)\\n\\nI get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable. That said, I’m very interested to get my hands on this release.   \n11648                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              My takeaway was that across MacOS, iOS and iPadOS I found very few things that I could tell I would include in my daily use.\\n\\nI already use 1Password so Apple Passwords is not useful for me. I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions. \\n\\nI could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter!\\n\\nI just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro. \\n\\nThis came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\"\\n\\nI already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup. \\n\\nApple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels.\\n\\nSoftwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good. I'm not talking about launchers or widgets here, but just a variety of toggles that alter how its vast array of features works.\\n\\nSo, I'm out, except for Mac.   \n\n      published_at_date      app  \\\n11644        2024-06-11  YouTube   \n11645        2024-06-10  YouTube   \n11646        2024-06-10   Reddit   \n11647        2024-06-10   Reddit   \n11648        2024-06-12   Reddit   \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             final_text  \\\n11644                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I'm skeptical about selling VR headsets as productivity tools, especially given their current bulkiness and discomfort. It's too early to try to make VR a normal work tool. My phone requirements are simple: good camera, no notches, stereo speakers, headphone jack, expandable storage, and a customizable home screen like Palm's WebOS. Unfortunately, few devices fit these criteria, and none are iPhones. I do appreciate some apps, like the new iPad OS calculator app, which uses OCR and AI well. However, I'm not impressed with most AI-powered features, as they often struggle with language and image processing. I'd love to see AI used to optimize camera settings and take better photos. Faster sensors could help adjust settings and merge images like the Light camera. This feature would be awesome and currently unmatched. I'm disappointed Apple didn't announce updated high-end Mac products, leaving no official news on the M3 or M4 Ultra chip or next-gen Mac Pro. Content creators reliant on Macs should be impatient for these updates.   \n11645                                                                                                                           My initial impression is that Apple is catching up on quality of life features. They could have implemented them years ago, especially summarization, which was already available on Mac. I've asked for this feature to be system-wide on iPads and iPhones. Other features, like increased Tapback options, are exciting but similar to those found in other apps. Google Photos and Amazon already had some of these features. I predict that within five years, the iPad will become more powerful, and the Files app will be reformed. The only original features I saw at WWDC were image and emoji generation, which felt like mockups with twists. I'm not criticizing Apple for adopting these features, but I miss the days of feature-packed updates on Mac. The iPad has become more buggy, and I feel like it's being neglected. Many features can be replicated on the iPhone or Mac, making me question why I should pay $1000 for the iPad Pro when the $300 iPad does the same thing. I'm also disappointed that features from Mac, like better app organization, weren't brought to the iPad earlier. Quinn from Snazzy Labs highlighted this issue perfectly, pointing out Apple's failure to address iPad problems.   \n11646  Apple had a huge WWDC, with many exciting features across their platforms. VisionOS 2 introduces 2k native apps, 1.5m compatible apps, and impressive photography features. iOS 18 brings a new Home Screen, customizable widgets, and improved Control Center. Other features include a rearranged Home Screen, mouse support, and new APIs. The Photos app has been redesigned, and Mail has added on-device categorization and AI-powered email summaries. On the Applewatch side, watchOS 11 introduces a new Training Mode, fitness tracking enhancements, and improved vitals tracking. tvOS gets Insight in video to identify actors and music, and spatial audio. iPadOS 18 brings Shareplay, a redesigned app bar, and a calculator app. macOS Sequoia adds iPhone mirroring, tiling and snapping, and a new Passwords app. The Safari browser gets Highlights, summaries, and picture-in-picture mode. Apple Intelligence, a new AI platform, is being integrated across the system, offering features like writing tools, proofreading, and summarization. Siri gets improved language understanding, type-to-Siri, and on-screen awareness. Finally, ChatGPT 4o is a new AI-powered chatbot that can answer general knowledge questions and generate complex images. Overall, it was a jam-packed WWDC with many exciting features and integrations.   \n11647                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I'm excited about the recent updates, but there are a few features that didn't initially win me over. I'm not a fan of Microsoft's generative features being integrated into their software, and I don't think I'll use them here. I prefer Apple's Siri features, which I think are more essential for me.

I prefer BetterTouchTool's snap functions for corner splits. I recently traded in my 2017 iPad Pro for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ at a lower cost.

I already use a Samsung Fold 4, which I love despite its unreliability. Apple's lack of innovative features is a dilemma, making it hard to upgrade since I'm not missing out on much.

Heavy enough that wearing it for the duration of its battery life can become legitimately uncomfortable to bear. Once they figure out how to use nanostructure lensing to create something roughly the size of a pair of bulky glasses, then it'll be viable as a productivity tool. Go ahead and make it wired with a belt clip or harnessed compute module, I really don't mind, but don't try to normalize people trying to get actual work done with a VR toaster strapped to their face.\\n====================================\\nMy requirements for a phone are actually quite simple: \\n-a camera with acceptable image quality\\n-no distracting hole-punch or notch in the display\\n-stereo front-facing speakers\\n-a headphone jack as backup for when I need it\\n-expandable storage for when I need it\\n-the ability to make my home screen look like Palm's WebOS\\n\\nThus far, the number of devices that fit that bill are very, very small and have never included the iPhone.\\n====================================\\nOkay, I will admit that the new calculator app on iPad OS 18 is legitimately one of the best hands-on applications of OCR and AI interpretation that I've seen in a while. It wouldn't benefit me at all because my handwriting is atrocious, but it's still ridiculously cool to see.\\n====================================\\nI honestly wish I could care about all of these AI features, but I really don't. An enhanced spell-checker and grammar+syntax checker would be nice, but AI has repeatedly demonstrated that the English language is quite a challenge for it. Photo editing is a good use case for it, but even then, that relies on the photo being taken well in the first place and the camera app can be a bit flaky about adjusting white balance, gamma, exposure, focus, stabilization, etc. I'd be most interested in them applying AI to properly optimize the shot in the first place. Couple that with some stupid fast sensors so it can make a few tweaks to the settings, take a few photos in one go, then use AI and it's image processor to merge the image into something like what the Light camera could do. The ability to shift focus while making adjustments to all of the usual corrections in exposure, but with the data from a bunch of different images taken with different settings to draw from so you never lose detail would be an awesome feature that even Google can't offer yet.\\n====================================\\nI'm a bit disappointed that Apple didn't make any announcements about their TOTL Mac products, so there's no official news yet about an M3 or M4 Ultra chip or the next generation of Mac Pro. Content creators who rely heavily on Mac should also be feeling impatient to know when the next generation of these TOTL Apple silicon powered devices will be available.</td>\n      <td>2024-06-11</td>\n      <td>YouTube</td>\n      <td>I'm skeptical about selling VR headsets as productivity tools, especially given their current bulkiness and discomfort.

My phone requirements are simple: good camera, no notches, stereo speakers, headphone jack, expandable storage, and a customizable home screen like Palm's WebOS. Unfortunately, few devices fit these criteria, and none are iPhones. I do appreciate some apps, like the new iPad OS calculator app, which uses OCR and AI well. However, I'm not impressed with most AI-powered features, as they often struggle with language and image processing. I'd love to see AI used to optimize camera settings and take better photos. Faster sensors could help adjust settings and merge images like the Light camera. This feature would be awesome and currently unmatched.

There's so much to process. There are a handful of things that I didn't really like at first glance:\\n\\n1. All of the generative features. I didn't like how Microsoft started baking them into their software, and I don't really like them here. Can't place my finger on *why.* I feel like the Siri features are more essential for me. I'm **really** excited to play around with an enhanced Siri.\\n2. The color-tinted icons. The effect reminds me of those cheap icon packs that circulated on the Play Store years ago. A developer would take official icons, add a tint, then dump them on the store en masse. I feel as though Apple heard the folks that have been wanting custom icon support, and this is some kind of stopgap.\\n3. The Passwords app. I get this is going to be useful for many, many users that don't have good password management and hygiene. That said, I use Bitwarden. I really hope Apple doesn't begin to shove their Password solution down my throat.\\n4. How blatantly ChatGPT branding is baked into the user-experience. Like, *whaaaat*? It feels very un-Apple to me. I love how native search engine support with auto-suggestions isn't supported on iOS — if you've ever tried to Google something from Spotlight, you probably know my pain — but I **can** have an OS-level supported ChatGPT conversation with ChatGPT branding? Wild.  \\n5. (Honestly, I'm glad they brought window snapping to Mac OS. That feature has been missing for so, so long. Stage Manager is not for me and never will be. That said, the 'old man' in me has really grown accustomed to my Swish + Alt-Tab setup. Hopefully I don't have to fight with these new OS features to continue using those tools.)\\n6. (I find it ironic that the Settings app has become so complicated to navigate that a major sales pitch from today’s presentation was using the raw power of Apple’s flagship LLM to… navigate through settings. Not a complaint about the AI feature. Seems good. I’ll use it. I just feel that the Settings app has some other problems that seeing this feature triggered in my mind.)\\n\\nI get that there will be people that will use or benefit from these features, but as both a Software Engineer and consumer, feature bloat always makes me a little uncomfortable.

I can already do corner splits with BetterTouchTool's snap functions. \\n\\nI could have used something like improvements to MacOS virtual desktop handling instead, e.g naming desktops, arranging them in some other manner than a horizontal line, separating desktops vs fullscreen apps etc. It's one feature I use every day that is woefully forgotten by Apple. And Microsoft for that matter!\\n\\nI just shipped off my 2017 iPad Pro 12.9\" in a trade-in for a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ 12.4\". That way I got most of what the 2024 iPad Pro 12.9\" offers at about 1/3 of the cost thanks to steep sales + trade-in value. The S9+ 16:10 format is not ideal, but it is more compact than the old iPad Pro. \\n\\nThis came at a good time right when Apple announced my iPad Pro would not have gotten iOS 18 anyway. Not that it matters much, because there were exactly zero features showcased that made me go \"I want that!\"\\n\\nI already moved away from iOS to the Samsung Galaxy Fold 4. With the discontinuation of the iPhone Mini line, I was left to pick from what I wanted to get away from - phones larger than I'd like! I like the Fold because when folded it is similar width to the iPhone 12 Mini I was using, obviously just taller, heavier and much thicker. It has not been the most reliable phone, but when it works I really do love the foldable thing and Apple has nothing like that in their lineup. \\n\\nApple is facing a dilemma where they make great hardware, but then have very few incentives for people to upgrade. I could easily be using something as old as the iPhone XS and not feel like I'm getting a lesser experience vs the latest and greatest iPhone Pro unless I'm really into photography. Great for a consumer, but not good business. We have gone from \"worth upgrading every 1-2 years\" to \"why bother upgrading if it still works\" as phone/tablet costs have crept up to very pricy levels.\\n\\nSoftwarewise, Samsung OneUI allows so many things that finetune its features to my liking, so it feels more like I can make it mine instead of adapting to what Apple thinks is good.

The doubtful sentiment classifications and knowing the general sentiment already of commenters' sentiment on specific topics, the model seemed to not have performed well.
